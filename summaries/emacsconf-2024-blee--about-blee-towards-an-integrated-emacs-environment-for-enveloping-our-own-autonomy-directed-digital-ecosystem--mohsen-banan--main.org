* About Blee Towards An Integrated Emacs Environment For Enveloping Our Own Autonomy Directed Digital Ecosystem
:PROPERTIES:
:SPEAKER: Mohsen Banan
:END:

** Key Points
- Emacs as a primary ingredient for an autonomy and morality directed digital ecosystem
- Augmenting Emacs with cohesive elisp capabilities and creating Blee (ByStar Libre-Halaal Emacs Environment)
- Combining Blee with Debian and BISOS to form a foundation for ByStar, a non-proprietary digital ecosystem
- Redecentralization of internet application services through ByStar
- Raising the bar on Emacs integration and recognizing the value of smaller, well-integrated environments
