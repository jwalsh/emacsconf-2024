* Reimagining The Emacs User Experience With Casual Suite
:PROPERTIES:
:SPEAKER: Charles Choi
:END:

** Key Points
- Emacs user experience relies too much on recall, making it difficult for users to access infrequently used commands
- Completion in history can help with recognition, but only by a little bit
- Keyboard-driven menus are being reimagined using Transient library
- Transient library allows for pinned and state-updated menus that reflect internal state changes made by commands issued from the user

| Term                    | Definition                                                                                  | Context                                                |
|-------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------|
| recall interface design | Interface where users must remember commands and actions from memory without visual aids    | Emacs UX relies heavily on users remembering commands  |
| completion              | Suggests possible actions based on partial input to help users recognize rather than recall | Used in command history but provides limited help      |
| Transient library       | Emacs package providing dynamic, contextual menus that make commands more discoverable      | Used to reimagine keyboard-driven menu interfaces      |
| pinning                 | Feature to keep menus visible and automatically updated based on system state               | Enables persistent menus that reflect command outcomes |
| mode complexity         | Difficulty arising from modes having many interrelated functions and features               | Addressed by improving command discoverability         |
