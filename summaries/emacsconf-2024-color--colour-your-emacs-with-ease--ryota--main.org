| HSL Colour Space            | A colour model that describes colours in terms of hue (colour), saturation (purity), and lightness (brightness)                           | Hue, Saturation, Lightness               |
| LCH Colour Space            | Another colour model that describes colours in terms of luminance (lightness), chroma (colourfulness), and hue                            | Luminance or Lightness, Chroma, Hue      |
| Perceptual Uniformity       | A property of a colour space where the perceived colours are evenly distributed, making it more suitable for designing themes and colours | Perceptual uniformity                    |
| CIE                         | An organization that developed important colour spaces like CIE XYZ, CIELAB, and LUV                                                      | International Commission of Illumination |
