* Beguiling Emacs Guileemacs Relaunched
:PROPERTIES:
:SPEAKER: Robin Templeton
:END:

** Key Points
- The Guile-Emacs project aims to use Guile as the basis for Emacs's Lisp support.
- Guile-Emacs has two main components: a new Lisp compiler and a variant of Emacs with Guile Elisp
- The combination of these projects will improve performance, increase expressiveness, and reduce C reliance
- Guile was chosen for its support for multiple languages using its compiler tower
- Guile's compiler optimizations occur at the Tree-IL layer or lower
- The project has a long history with previous implementation attempts dating back to the 1990s
