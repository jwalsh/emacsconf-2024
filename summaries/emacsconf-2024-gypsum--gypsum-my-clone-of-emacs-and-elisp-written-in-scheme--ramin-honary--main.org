* Gypsum My Clone Of Emacs And Elisp Written In Scheme
:PROPERTIES:
:SPEAKER: Ramin Honary
:END:

** Key Points
- Ramin Honary is an Emacs enthusiast who has been working on a project to write an Emacs Lisp interpreter in Scheme
- He wants to create a clone of Emacs that can run any 'init.el' and stick closely to the R7RS standard Scheme definition
- The goal is to make the project widely adoptable across different Scheme implementations, including Guile
