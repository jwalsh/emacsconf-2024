| High-level dynamic programming language | A high-level programming language is one that abstracts away low-level details and provides a more concise syntax, making it easier to write code without worrying about the underlying hardware.                                                  | Definition of a high-level programming language |
| Multiple dispatch                       | Multiple dispatch is a programming paradigm where a function call is resolved by looking at the types of every single argument involved, rather than just the type of the first argument.                                                          | Julia's multiple dispatch mechanism             |
| Just-in-time compilation with LLVM      | Just-in-time (JIT) compilation is a technique where code is compiled into machine code at runtime, rather than beforehand. LLVM is a modular compiler infrastructure that provides a framework for building JIT compilers.                         | Julia's just-in-time compilation with LLVM      |
| Elisp                                   | Extensibility refers to the ability of a software system to be modified or extended without affecting its core functionality. In Emacs, this is achieved through the use of Elisp, a dialect of Lisp that allows users to write custom extensions. | Emacs' extensibility features                   |
| Package ecosystem                       | A community refers to a group of people who share common interests or goals. In Emacs, the community is driven by the development of packages, which are reusable pieces of code that can be easily installed and used.                            | Emacs' community and package ecosystem          |
| REPL                                    | A REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) is an interactive shell where users can enter expressions and see the results immediately. In Julia, the REPL provides a powerful tool for exploratory programming.                                                  | Julia's REPL-driven workflow                    |
