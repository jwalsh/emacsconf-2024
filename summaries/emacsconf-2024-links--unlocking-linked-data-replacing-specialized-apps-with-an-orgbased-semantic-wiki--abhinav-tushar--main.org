** Key Points
- The speaker wants to use Emacs and Org Mode for managing all their data, replacing specialized apps.
- Using specialized applications like Raindrop, Zotero, and Monica CRM leads to siloed data and hard linking between apps.
- Org Roam provides a linked notes system, but the speaker feels it lacks tools for working with links.
- The speaker wants to extend Org Roam to provide seamless integration with external applications and browsers.
