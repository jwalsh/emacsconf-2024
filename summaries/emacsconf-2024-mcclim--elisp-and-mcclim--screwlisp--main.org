:SPEAKER: Screwlisp
:END:

** Key Points
- Porting a 1978 demo application from Interlisp to Emacs Lisp
- Using inferior-lisp and McCLIM (Common Lisp interface manager) in Superior Lisp
- Improvising a presentation mode without Org Mode, using slime-mode or ielm-mode
- Creating a keyboard macro to manipulate S-expressions in the buffer

| EmacsLisp     | EmacsLisp is a dialect of Lisp that is specifically designed for use with the Emacs text editor. It includes features such as macro expansion, recursion, and control structures like if-else statements.                                                                                          | defuns, defvars, and other EmacsLisp constructs |
| inferior-lisp | Inferior Lisp refers to a version of the Lisp programming language that is embedded within another program or environment, in this case, Emacs. It provides a way for users to write and execute Lisp code within the Emacs editor.                                                                | inferior-lisp                                   |
| McCLIM        | McCLIM (Common Lisp Interface Manager) is an open-source implementation of the Common Lisp interface manager, which provides a way for Lisp programs to interact with the outside world. It allows developers to create graphical user interfaces and other interactive systems using Common Lisp. | McCLIM                                          |
| slime-mode    | Slime-mode is a major mode in Emacs that provides a way for users to interact with the SLIME (Steel Bank EmacsLisp Interface Manager) interface manager, which allows developers to create graphical user interfaces and other interactive systems using Common Lisp.                              | slime-mode                                      |
| ielm-mode     | ielm-mode is a major mode in Emacs that provides an interactive environment for loading and testing Common Lisp code, similar to slime-mode but with some differences.                                                                                                                             | ielm-mode                                       |
