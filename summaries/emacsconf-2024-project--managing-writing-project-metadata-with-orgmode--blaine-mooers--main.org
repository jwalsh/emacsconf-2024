:PROPERTIES:
:SPEAKER: Blaine Mooers
:END:

** Key Points
- Blaine Mooers discusses utilizing Org mode for writing project metadata log files, specifically for research articles.
- He shares his template for this file on GitHub and explains how it helps with navigation and organization.
- Mooers describes his workflow in structural biology, from X-ray crystallography to analyzing protein structures.
- He introduces the concept of assigning a unique index number to each project and using it for folder and file naming.
- Blaine highlights the importance of having a writing log at the center of his process, which guides him through the development of a central hypothesis.
- He emphasizes the use of templates in Org mode and other markup languages like R Markdown and LaTeX.
- Mooers also discusses the benefits of using Typst, an independent document processor inspired by LaTeX but written in Rust.
