* Emacs Regex Compilation And Future Directions For Expressive Pattern Matching
:PROPERTIES:
:SPEAKER: Danny Mcclanahan
:END:

** Key Points
- The talk will discuss the compilation of Emacs regular expressions and future directions for expressive pattern matching.
- The speaker's experience is rooted in build tools and package managers, which led to a desire to improve the efficiency of text parsing and processing.
- The discussion will focus on patterns in text parsing and how it relates to formal languages and computation.
- Emacs regex engine was implemented using old C code, but modern techniques may not be compatible or desirable.
- There are larger goals that emacs-devel discussed, which overlap with the speaker's research interests and make for exciting discussions.
