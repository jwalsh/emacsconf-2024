* An Experimental Emacs Core In Rust
:PROPERTIES:
:SPEAKER: Troy Hinckley
:END:

** Key Points
- Now discussing the Emacs core
- Emacs has a long history
- Rune creates an opportunity for experimentation and trying new approaches
- Rust protects from undefined behavior and memory unsafety, but also enables fast performance with a strong ecosystem
- Multi-threading in Rust is enabled through 'fearless concurrency'
- Comparison to other Rust and Emacs projects: Remacs and Emacs-NG
