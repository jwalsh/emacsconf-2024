* Emacs As A Shell
:PROPERTIES:
:SPEAKER: Christopher Howard
:END:

** Key Points
- Emacs is not just an editor or development environment, but can be thought of as a shell that allows interaction with the rest of the system through commands
- Emacs can provide most of the functionality expected from a shell
- Using Emacs as a shell instead of other shells like Bash is possible and beneficial
- Running a terminal emulator within Emacs is not necessary and may hinder performance
- Emacs has its own built-in terminal emulator, but it's not the primary intention of using Emacs as a shell
