** Key Points
- I introduced the concept of an opinionated starter kit for authors who write for humans, not for programmers who write for computers.
- After analyzing my research and writing workflow, I developed Emacs Writing Studio (EWS) as a comprehensive solution to help authors manage their writing projects.
- EWS is based on three main steps: inspiration, ideation, and production. It uses Org mode for note-taking and managing bibliographies.
- The book that accompanies EWS is written entirely in Org mode.
- I used the standard keyboard shortcuts in Emacs and avoided customizations whenever possible to keep things simple.
- EWS includes packages like Denote for note tagging, citar for accessing bibliographies, and vertico for minibuffer completion.
- The focus of EWS is on providing a streamlined writing experience that minimizes distractions and maximizes productivity.
- I believe EWS can help authors overcome the paradox of choice in Emacs by making deliberate design decisions about their workflow.
