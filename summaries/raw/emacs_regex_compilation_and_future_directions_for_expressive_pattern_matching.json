    "The talk will discuss the compilation of Emacs regular expressions and future directions for expressive pattern matching.",
    "The speaker's experience is rooted in build tools and package managers, which led to a desire to improve the efficiency of text parsing and processing.",
    "The discussion will focus on patterns in text parsing and how it relates to formal languages and computation.",
    "Emacs regex engine was implemented using old C code, but modern techniques may not be compatible or desirable.",
    "There are larger goals that emacs-devel discussed, which overlap with the speaker's research interests and make for exciting discussions."
