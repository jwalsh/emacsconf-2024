00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.660
 Greetings, Salon.

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.540
 This is Mohsen Banon, I am a software and internet engineer.

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:16.380
 The title of this presentation is "About Blee".

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:22.460
 Blee stands for "By Star Liber Halal Imax Environment".

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:29.700
 In this presentation, I want to look at Imax as a primary ingredient for the usage environment

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:35.800
 of an autonomy and morality-directed digital ecosystem.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.380
 My focus here is not just Imax.

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:46.740
 This is about augmenting Imax in the context of our own specific digital ecosystem.

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:50.740
 This presentation is part theoretical and part practical.

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:55.020
 I spend about half of my time on the theory and the bigger picture.

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.860
 The second half is hands-on and Imax's century.

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:08.420
 Imax has long been recognized as the ultimate integration platform, enabling the creation

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.960
 of an unparalleled user environment.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:19.300
 Tomohiro is right on the mark when he says, "The reason why Imax's platform is good is

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:25.100
 that it cooperates with OS, not because it's good by itself."

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:31.820
 But this recognition has often been in the context of a generic and abstract OS.

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:39.200
 So I am updating Matsumaya's observation as, "The reason why Imax's platform is good

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:47.380
 is that it facilitates creation of specific integrated usage environments, like Blee,

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:55.380
 which cooperates with Debian and Bysos as part of the Liber Halal Bistor digital ecosystem."

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:05.180
 Imax is an especially good choice as the universal core of usaving environments of a digital

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:12.880
 ecosystem, because it has an incredibly powerful display engine and an incredibly powerful

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:19.880
 ellipse engine, and an incredibly powerful input methods engine, and an incredibly powerful

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:27.640
 common agent's paradigm, and the very rich set of mature and convivial idioms and memes

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:35.960
 for absorption and integration of external software services continuum capabilities.

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:43.680
 In our model, we first augment Imax with a set of cohesive ellipse capabilities and create

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:49.080
 Blee, Bistor Liber Halal Imax's environment.

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:57.880
 We then further enhance Blee with an integrated framework on top of Debian called Bysos, by

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:06.560
 store internet services operating system. Blee is inherently intertwined and integrated

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:14.620
 with Bysos. This combination of universal Bysos and Blee then forms a foundation for the

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:23.560
 creation of an autonomy-directed digital ecosystem that we call Bysos.

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:30.720
 Over the past two decades, I have been working on creating a comprehensive interdisciplinary

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:38.320
 and non-properiatory digital ecosystem. We call it Bysos. Bysos challenges the existing

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:46.160
 proprietary American digital ecosystem while operating concurrently alongside it.

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:55.000
 Bysos' primary offerings are tangible autonomy and genuine privacy on a very large scale.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:03.920
 Bysos is about re-decentralization of internet application services. The store in Bysos stands

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:13.760
 for Unix's gloving symbol, signifying that our scope is everything. Blee is a bigger and

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:20.760
 different vision for Imax. Let's compare and contrast what I'm proposing against common

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:28.240
 current practices of the Imax culture. Please permit me to be slightly cynical.

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:35.440
 Much of what we have been seeing in the Imax culture and in Imax Conf can be characterized

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:43.880
 as stories of tunnel vision engineers, scratching various issues by integrating various capabilities

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:52.000
 and providing DIY recipes. Imax and Lisb are so powerful that people have come up with

00:04:52.000 --> 00:05:02.160
 catch phrases like the Curse of Lisb. The Curse is that the power of Lisb breeds individualism.

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:08.720
 If you can be so powerful alone, you work longer alone. Because it's easy to spin your

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:17.060
 own whatever library many people do. I'm suggesting that we should raise the bar. Let's cultivate

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:26.800
 Imax in the context of our own digital ecosystem instead. Do more and do more outside of Imax

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:35.840
 and recognize that a well-integrated smaller Imax leads to a better usage environment.

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:42.480
 Broadly speaking, digital ecosystems are viewed as consisting of four parts. Ideology

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:49.840
 software services and content. Software services and content are poly-existentials and can

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:56.320
 be analyzed from three different aspects, functionality, usage and the manner of existence.

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:03.040
 By manner of existence of poly-existentials, we mean everything relating to how the

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:08.720
 poly-existential exists within society. This includes, for example,

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:15.520
 or poly-existentials internally transparent. Societal ideology determines

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:23.360
 manner of software services and content and in turn manner of existence of software services

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:31.680
 and content impact society. In the American model, loss of privacy and autonomy are direct

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:40.240
 consequences of the IPR regime. Based on this characterization, let's consider these three

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:47.360
 digital ecosystems, the proprietary American digital ecosystem, force and by store.

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:54.640
 The five big American proprietary tech companies, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Facebook and Amazon,

00:06:54.640 --> 00:07:02.160
 have created five competing enclaves as mostly separate and isolated digital ecosystem.

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:10.000
 In this slide, I'm focusing on the first three and each of their OSs, their usage environment

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:17.520
 and their clouds. Let's clearly recognize that the economic model of these proprietary digital

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:24.800
 ecosystems is surveillance capitalism. Now, let's focus on the right side of this picture.

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:31.840
 On the non-properatory side, based on the first model, we have ended up with lots of components.

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:38.160
 We have Debian as a platform. We have Emacs as an editor-centered usage environment,

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:44.640
 but on the non-properatory side, we don't have anything that can reasonably be considered

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:50.240
 a digital ecosystem. I mean, the services aspect is missing.

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:57.600
 By store, aspires to be a complete non-properatory digital ecosystem.

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:03.440
 We were all born into the belief system of intellectual property rights,

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:12.480
 making it exceedingly difficult for us to even imagine that this foundational ownership framework

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:20.240
 could be fundamentally flawed. I am delighted to announce the availability of my recent book,

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:28.880
 Nature of Polyexistent Shows. The full title of my book is Nature of Polyexistent Shows,

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:34.400
 basis for abolishment of the Western intellectual property rights regime,

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:40.800
 and introduction of the Liber Hallal by store digital ecosystem.

00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:49.200
 Now, let's know how users of know how ideas, formulas, software and information are inherently

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:57.680
 non-scars. They are polyexistent Shows. Unlike mono-existent Shows, which exist in singular,

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:06.800
 polyexistent Shows naturally exist in multiples. What is abundant in nature is being made

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:13.760
 artificially scarce through man-made ownership rules called copyright and patents.

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:20.720
 Let me provide a brief overview. This book is divided into five parts,

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:27.280
 each representing a layer of interest to you and to our societal policy makers.

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:34.240
 Part one, the philosophical layer, delves into the concept of polyexistence.

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:43.600
 In this part, I introduce, for the very first time, the concept and terminology of polyexistent Shows.

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:50.640
 The topic of restriction of polyexistent Shows and the Western IPR is one and the same.

00:09:51.520 --> 00:10:00.080
 Comprehending polyexistence invalidates the Western IPR model. We are living inside of an ownership

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:09.440
 fallacy. The Western IPR regime is a sin of our times. Part two is the pathology layer.

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:16.560
 Over the course of the past two centuries, numerous theories have been proposed to justify

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:24.080
 intellectual property. In this part, I offer my perspective on the weaknesses inherent

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:31.680
 in each of these theories. Part three, the ethics layer, focuses on contours of cures.

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:39.280
 Having dismissed the Western intellectual property rights regime as an erroneous governance

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:48.400
 model for polyexistent Shows, I propose the Lieber Hallal model of governance of polyexistent Shows

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:57.680
 towards facilitating conviviality of tools. Part four, the engineering layer introduces the Lieber

00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:06.160
 Hallal by Spur digital ecosystem as an ethical alternative to the prevailing proprietary American

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:15.760
 digital ecosystem. Part five, the sociology layer delves into formulation of Lieber Hallal oriented

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:24.080
 societal policies. It's evident that the abolishment of intellectual property carries significant

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:32.880
 consequences. In this part, I present my thoughts on this particular dimension for Eastern societies.

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:39.440
 For Western societies, I confine myself to inside of IPR strategies.

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:48.160
 You can think of this book as being in two volumes. Our focus is Blee in volume two.

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:56.160
 But as our blueprint needs to be interdisciplinary, there are some key concepts of volume one

00:11:56.160 --> 00:12:04.640
 that I want to briefly discuss here. Volume one deals with the general concept of polyexistence

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:14.560
 and in validity of IPR. In chapter 11, I introduce the very sensitive and potent vocabulary

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:23.360
 of Hallal and Lieber Hallal. Volume two is backed by software and internet services. Content of this

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:31.840
 book belongs to all of humanity and verbatim copying of it is unrestricted. If you want to read it,

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:40.080
 this book is yours. The nature of polyexistentials book is available both online and in print.

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:47.440
 This book is available as two editions, the US edition and the international edition.

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:57.280
 The US edition is written with a slightly milder Western unfriendly tone, while the international edition

00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:05.120
 includes additional original content in foresee. I consider the international edition

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:12.320
 to be the authoritative version. However, many readers in the US and Western countries

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:20.720
 may prefer the US edition. I maintain separate Git repositories for each edition on GitHub.

00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:35.120
 US edition is BXPLPC12033 and international edition is BXPLPC12074.

00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:44.800
 Cloning these repositories will give you access to the book in PDF format, suitable for both

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:54.960
 A4 and US letter printing and in EPUB format. Alternatively, the content can be downloaded directly

00:13:54.960 --> 00:14:04.720
 from your browser without needing to clone the repositories. To ensure broader online availability

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:15.200
 and stability, I have also published the book on Zenodo, complete with the UI digital object identifier.

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:24.160
 You can download both the A4 and 8.5 by 11 PDFs from there as well.

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:33.280
 The book is also available in print on Amazon and most major bookstores in the US and Western regions.

00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:40.000
 The ISBNs for both editions are included in this slide. Additionally,

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:47.840
 I have published this book in Iran through Djangal publishers. I did not write this book for profit.

00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:54.560
 My aim is to share my thoughts and encourage readers to engage with my views and ideas.

00:14:54.560 --> 00:15:00.720
 Your feedback is welcome and I'm genuinely interested in hearing your perspectives.

00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:08.320
 In Western markets, I have priced the print edition somewhat above production costs.

00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:16.080
 If you find the value in the book and the by store project, purchasing a copy will help support

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:26.000
 my work. Thanks in advance for your support. And here are the same links as a native reveal slide.

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:32.480
 If instead of a video you are viewing this presentation as a reveal web page,

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:36.080
 you can just click on the pointers and URLs.

00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:45.200
 The concept of poly-existentials has not appeared in prior discussions of validity of IPR.

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:51.680
 Once you start thinking in terms of mono-existence and poly-existence,

00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:58.000
 the recognition of illegitimacy of Western IPR becomes very simple.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:05.280
 I want to very quickly give you a taste of that. You can of course dig deeper in the book.

00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:12.480
 Existence and possession are aspects of nature, ownership or man-made rules.

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:18.720
 All material objects exist in singular and are mono-existentials.

00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:27.440
 For mono-existentials things are simple. Mono-existentials say paper exists in singular.

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:36.800
 It naturally has a single processor. A single owner can be assigned to it, which then makes that

00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:43.760
 single possession lawful. Poly-existentials naturally exist in multiples.

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:51.040
 Much of our world is actually a mixture of mono-existentials and poly-existentials,

00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:54.720
 which we call mixed-existentials.

00:16:54.720 --> 00:17:03.760
 Possession and of poly-existentials is naturally many to many. Without any conflict,

00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:12.560
 poly-existentials can have many processors. Poly-existentials are inherently non-ravalry.

00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:20.560
 The requirement for ownership to be in harmony with the nature of possession and existence

00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:28.720
 is violated by the Western IPR regime, which assigns a single owner to what exists

00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:36.080
 and is possessed in multiples. The end result is creation of artificial scarcity.

00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:44.160
 Ramification of ownership mistakes are usually catastrophic. Consider the previous

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:51.920
 Western and American ownership mistake, that of American slavery, ownership of Africans

00:17:51.920 --> 00:18:00.240
 by Americans and Europeans. See Chapter 7, Western slavery and the Western IPR regime

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:08.640
 of the book for some parallels between these mistakes. This time with the Western IPR ownership

00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:17.920
 mistake, all of humanity is in danger. So, how are we to correct this catastrophic mistake?

00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:27.360
 The strategies of public licenses and false are not sufficient. These are minor band-aids. We need

00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:34.320
 to do a lot more. We need to understand what we are going to replace the mistaken Western IPR

00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:43.680
 regime with. My answer is Liber Halal Governance of Poly-existentials. Much of my book revolves

00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:52.080
 around that. We need to fully reject ownership of poly-existentials and replace it with attribution

00:18:52.080 --> 00:19:00.560
 machineries towards just rewards. We need to abolish the artificial scarcity

00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:08.160
 of poly-existentials that the Western IPR regime has created and restore poly-existentials

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:14.080
 back to their natural state, that of non-rival-ruse public goods.

00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:24.400
 By now, many Western-as and many West-toxicated are thinking, these are empty slogans that are going

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:32.160
 nowhere. And they are right. Copyright and patents are fully entrenched in the West. But what about

00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:38.240
 the rest of the world? What about the Chinese, the Iranians, Brazilians, Cubans and the rest?

00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:46.160
 The intellectual property rights regime is not universal. There is more to the world than the West.

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:54.160
 What if the WTO was to be recognized for what it is, the Western trade organization?

00:19:54.160 --> 00:20:03.280
 Thus far, I have been discussing the nature of all poly-existentials, any formula, in any form.

00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:11.120
 Next, I want to turn our attention to digitals in general and software in particular.

00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:19.680
 Software is a very special form of poly-existentials. Software is immediately useful, software

00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:29.280
 produces tools. Digital, as text, music, video, etc. are a pure form of poly-existentials that are

00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:37.680
 controlled by software. As developers, we know well that we can best produce good software through

00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:45.840
 collaboration. In that collaborative model, the software itself performs a collaborative road.

00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:53.520
 Software functions as a vessel for accumulation of our expert component contributions.

00:20:54.960 --> 00:21:00.880
 The Western IPR model cultivates artificial scarcities and competition.

00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:09.520
 But software developers instinctly recognize the superiority of the natural collaborative model.

00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:17.040
 Through public licenses, software developers have done a Juditsu on the IPR model

00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:24.240
 and have created a collaborative framework inside of the copyright model.

00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:30.400
 Based on that, natural public goods have defeated artificial scarcity.

00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:38.560
 Our success with software is proof that the entirety of the Western IPR regime is flawed.

00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:46.640
 The profession of software engineers need to create a relationship with society.

00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:54.480
 We need to demand for societal rules which establish proper manner of existence of software

00:21:54.480 --> 00:22:02.720
 and internet application services. In return, based on that, we should fulfill our guardianship role

00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:10.880
 and make sure that autonomy and privacy are preserved and that practice digital ecosystems

00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:18.000
 are healthy. To get there, we need to come up with the right label that represents the proper

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:24.320
 manner of existence of software. Those four, two labels have appeared on the scene,

00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:30.640
 free software and open source. I'm saying that both are problematic.

00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:38.080
 Free software is ill-directed. It is based on the model of granting users,

00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:46.880
 freedoms that are irrelevant to most software users. Perhaps copy left or ethical software

00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:55.360
 could have been better labels. Open source is a moral compromise. It rejects the requirement for

00:22:55.360 --> 00:23:04.080
 perpetuity of copy left. It facilitates convergence of corporate interest and surrogate activities

00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:11.920
 of software developers. Over time, proprietary corporations, too, have come to recognize

00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:19.200
 the superiority of the collaborative model. These proprietary corporations then derailed the

00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:27.520
 original intent that all software should always remain open source. With permissive public licenses

00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:35.440
 which permit open source becoming proprietary, the intent of open source has been marginalized

00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:43.840
 and permissive open source has become the norm. I expand on all of this in chapter 12, digital

00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:52.000
 non-properatory movements. Instead of free software and open source, the label that I introduce

00:23:52.000 --> 00:24:00.000
 is Lieberhalol. The Lieberhalol label is distinct and different from false labels.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:10.160
 As an inside of IPR strategy, the Lieberhalol label maps to a single public license, the AferoGPR.

00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:17.440
 In the Lieberhalol model, it's not up to the developer to choose their own licenses.

00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:25.200
 There's only one correct license that conveys the Lieberhalol manner of existence of software.

00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:33.360
 Also, unlike the false labels that dance around the validity of the Western IPR regime,

00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:41.600
 the Lieberhalol label recognizes the invalidity of the Western IPR regime, calls for

00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:48.720
 a "bollishment of the Western IPR" and suggests various outside of IPR strategies.

00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:54.960
 C. Part 5 Formulation of Societal Policies for Details

00:24:54.960 --> 00:25:03.440
 Furthermore, unlike false, which is just software-oriented, the Lieberhalol label goes

00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:09.040
 beyond software and also applies to internet application services.

00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:17.680
 In many ways, software is yesterday's news. Much of what we are experiencing today

00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:20.640
 is in the form of internet application services.

00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:27.360
 Internet application services provide remote access to execution of software.

00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:37.760
 As such, much of false has become proprietary internet application services, as AferoGPR is rarely used.

00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:46.400
 This is why the Lieberhalol definitions and labels span software and internet application services.

00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:54.400
 Based on the interdisciplinary state setting that the nature of poly-existentials

00:25:54.400 --> 00:26:00.960
 book provided and the by-store blueprint that we reviewed, we can now focus on Blee.

00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:07.840
 Think of Blee as a layer on top of Emacs and think of by-source as a layer on top of DBA.

00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:18.400
 Let's bootstrap raw-by-source and raw-blee. Starting from scratch, get yourself a fresh copy of DBA and 12.

00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:24.880
 Then go to github.com/bxgenesis-start.

00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:33.840
 The readmeat.org file at that github repo is same as chapter 18 of the book.

00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:43.680
 We will next run raw-by-source.chelle. But prior to that, let's take a quick look.

00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:52.880
 This bootstrap script will do a lot as root on your fresh DBA. It's best to first try it on a

00:26:52.880 --> 00:27:03.840
 disposable VM. Raw-by-source.sh adds the current DBA user to sudoes. Then it installs ppex.

00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:11.520
 And then with ppex, it installs from pypi by-source.provision.

00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:18.880
 By-source.provision includes additional batch scripts that are then executed.

00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:26.960
 Full installation involves setting up various accounts, group various directory hierarchies,

00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:33.840
 lots of up packages, and lots of Python packages. From the by-source name space.

00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:42.320
 If you're ready, copy and paste this line, and run it. You will be prompted for the root

00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:51.360
 password. Then be patient. Full installation can take 15 minutes or so. The logs of this script are

00:27:51.360 --> 00:28:03.760
 captured in raw-by-source.datetag.log.org. What has been installed on your system or raw-by-source

00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:11.920
 and raw-bly? The universality of DBA let's us build on by-source and bleed, both in the usage

00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:21.520
 environment and the service environment. With EMAX 3D now available on Android, and with termux

00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:29.600
 up packages infrastructure in place, it will be very viable to port by-source and bleed to Android.

00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:38.160
 We have not done so yet. We're waiting for EMAX 3D to mature up. This is by-source mobile

00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:46.080
 second strategy. Upon completion of the bootstrapping process, you end up with raw-by-source and

00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:54.160
 raw-bly. You then need to re-log in. At which point your notice that a new account called by-store

00:28:54.160 --> 00:29:03.440
 has been created. By-store is the default usage account. Let's log into it. You will see a customized

00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:12.000
 by-store GNOME desktop. You will also notice a bleed startup icon. Let's use it and start

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:21.120
 bleed. Notice that the EMAX splash screen has been replaced, and also note that this splash screen

00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:30.320
 is an org mode. All the original EMAX splash screen info is kept under about EMAX.

00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:40.560
 Let me enlarge the screen. Now we can live inside of bleed. Notice that the top drop-down EMAX

00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:50.480
 menus have been augmented. Everything to the left of the file menu is new. Notice the panels menu.

00:29:51.360 --> 00:30:01.200
 More on these later. Now let me get myself a shell and run tail/set-zip password.

00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:13.600
 Notice that a number of new accounts has been created. Notably by-source, by-store, and BPO-delimiter.

00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:24.560
 Let's next CD-to-by-source. Everything related to by-source is in here. The rest is as DBN was.

00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:36.240
 Let's take a look at /by-source-glie-nf3. All the e-list code for bleed is in here.

00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:46.400
 For now, bleed is layered on top of Doom. Robby-source and Robly are starting points. They are meant to be

00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:58.880
 customized. Let's next see how that is done. Robby-source and Robly are foundational layers. They

00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:06.800
 can be augmented in a variety of ways. The basic unit in the by-store model is the autonomous

00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:14.880
 site. Think of the autonomous site as the totality of computing and communication capabilities

00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:22.720
 in a modern family home, plus the ability of that family to host their own internet application

00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:31.840
 services. Let's walk through how Robby-source and Robly are used to construct an autonomous site.

00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:41.680
 By-source augmentation model is based on by-source capability bundles, BCBs. Robby-source can be

00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:50.000
 augmented to become a virtual machine hosting service. From there on, we can use reproducible

00:31:50.000 --> 00:32:00.480
 images to implement the infrastructure of sites. Took key services are the site BPO GitLab server

00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:07.760
 and site registrars. With these in place, we can facilitate self-hosting,

00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:16.720
 which in the by-source model is called possession-assertable liver services. These topics and these

00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:26.800
 concepts are described in Chapter 17, technology of by-store, by-source. The concepts of service

00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:34.000
 portability, service possession assertion, autonomous site and inner outer and exposed to

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:42.720
 rims of autonomous site or fundamental to by-store. These are shown in this figure as network

00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:52.880
 abodes. Chapter 17 of the book provides more details. Blee introduces a number of new concepts

00:32:52.880 --> 00:33:00.160
 that augment EMAX. Some of these are intertwined with by-source and by-store, but some are not.

00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:09.840
 Here, I provide some examples of these new general concepts. We love EMAX and we love Unix

00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:16.400
 because their design is convivial. By convivial, I'm referring to Ivan Illich's concept and

00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:25.920
 terminology of tools for conviviality. It was first published in 1973. It's a must read. A goal

00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:32.480
 of the design of the by-store digital ecosystem is to enlarge aggregated conviviality.

00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:41.840
 Here, let's start by reviewing the idioms and means that have made EMAX and Unix so very convivial

00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:48.400
 and some of the key idioms that have augmented them over the years. I'm showing them as

00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:57.120
 Linux++ and EMAX++. For the most part, these two philosophies have not been combined.

00:33:57.120 --> 00:34:05.280
 They were developed and have evolved mostly separately. Think of by-source idioms as an extension

00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:13.120
 of Linux++ idioms and think of BLEE idioms as an extension of EMAX++.

00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:21.520
 Then intertwined by-source and BLEE. This aggregated convivial tools powers by-store.

00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:30.400
 Let me first explain what I mean by aggregated convivial tools and then let me give some examples.

00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:38.480
 Here is a key sentence from Elyche's tools for conviviality in 1973 essay.

00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:47.440
 Convivial tools are those which give each person who uses them the greatest opportunity to enrich

00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:51.520
 the environment with the fruits of his or her vision.

00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:58.000
 Preparatory manner of existence of software makes them industrial.

00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:04.960
 Liber Halal Manerov existence of software is a prerequisite for conviviality.

00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:15.520
 The concept of org dynamic blocks is very powerful but why should they be primarily used in org mode?

00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:23.760
 I say let's generalize them to EMAX dynamic blocks. Have defaults for org-deblogs start

00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:30.880
 or E in every relevant mode and use them everywhere. BLEE does that.

00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:36.000
 In programming languages, dynamic blocks can be used as visible macros.

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:47.280
 For those of us who live inside of EMAX, enhancing programming with org mode capabilities is awesome,

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:56.000
 incredibly awesome. This can be done in two ways. One with literate programming and org

00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:06.080
 Babel and two with traditional surrounded programming and Comiga. Comiga stands for collaborative

00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:13.760
 org mode enhanced EMAX generalized authorship. It's just an acronym that I have come up with.

00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:22.800
 Literate programming and org Babel are well established. There is a related talk in EMAX

00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:33.440
 Conf 2024 titled literate programming for the 21st century. Comiga is the inverse of org Babel.

00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:43.280
 I prepare Comiga over org Babel because I prefer traditional surrounded programming over literate

00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:51.760
 programming. To each is on. This is not about that debate. This is about mixing your programming

00:36:51.760 --> 00:37:01.360
 mode with org mode. Much of BLEE and BISOS are implemented in Comiga. Almost all of our E list

00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:09.600
 python bash and latec work uses Comiga. Full and proper use of Comiga requires poly mode.

00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:16.160
 Let's call that poly Comiga. But EMAX's poly mode is working progress,

00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:25.520
 particularly now with the new three-sitter. So in the interim, my usage of Comiga has been

00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:33.040
 in the form of toggle Comiga, where I manually switch between the programming mode and org mode.

00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:37.760
 For me, this has proved to be a fine interim solution.

00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:48.000
 Yes. In EMAX, the way that we have been dealing with documentation and information retrieval

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:57.040
 is archaic. Man pages taken for helpful mode and convention-based doc strings are old and limited.

00:37:57.040 --> 00:38:05.600
 In BISOS and BLEE, we use BLEE panels for all kinds of documentation. Let me show you some examples.

00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:16.160
 Two fundamental autonomy oriented capabilities that by store offers to individuals are

00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:23.520
 email and content generation and publication. I'll give a quick overview of these two important

00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:34.480
 capabilities. At the EMAX CONF 2022, the title of my presentation was revisiting the anatomy of

00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:43.040
 EMAX male user agents. In that presentation, I gave a brief overview of BISOS, Mormie,

00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:52.240
 multi-account resident male exchange environment, and Bleegnose. In BISOS, these are typically

00:38:52.240 --> 00:39:01.200
 paired with byname.net autonomous email services. Content production and self-publication

00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:09.360
 is a foundational BLEE and BISOS capability bundle. Both this presentation and the nature of

00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:17.200
 PODY Existentials book were developed with BLEE LCNT. The original text is always in

00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:25.680
 Comiga latex, latex augmented by org mode. This is the inverse direction of exporting latex from

00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:34.320
 org mode. For typesetting, the latex syntax is far more powerful than org mode, and with

00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:43.920
 Comiga latex, you can also benefit from all that org mode offers. For presentation, screen

00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:52.720
 casting, the original text is then augmented in layers by images, audio voiceovers,

00:39:52.720 --> 00:40:00.480
 screen captures, videos, and captions. The BML latex file is then processed by both

00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:10.800
 latex and heavier. Latex produced slides are then absorbed in HTML by heavier as images.

00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:19.680
 Heavya is a latex to HTML converter. Heavya output is destined to be dispensed by reveal.js.

00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:26.560
 This video is just a screen capture of the autoplay of reveal file.

00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:35.280
 Viewing this presentation in its original revamped form is a very rich experience.

00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:44.560
 All of this involves a whole lot of integration scripting. In raw BISOS, these scripts are in

00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:47.760
 BISOS Core LCNT bin.

00:40:48.480 --> 00:41:03.040
 To say that BISOS and BLE or big-and-ambition is an understatement, and clearly, a small theme

00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:10.800
 won't be able to deliver the outlandish blueprint that is outlined in the nature of Polly Existentials book.

00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:21.040
 We have been at this for over two decades, and we feel that now, in 2024, it makes sense to involve you.

00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:31.280
 The pointer has an instructions for installation and usage of BISOS and BLE that I have provided.

00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:36.720
 Produced systems that are minimally functional, but are not cleaned.

00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:41.040
 At this time, don't expect stability and support.

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:49.360
 Throughout this presentation, I have been emphasizing service portability and possession

00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:58.160
 ascertainable labor services, PALS. But a complete digital ecosystem includes various other types of

00:41:58.160 --> 00:42:06.480
 Internet application services as well. In this slide, PALS are at the center and are then augmented

00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:13.680
 by different other types of services. In the BISOS Store model, equivalent of Facebook-style

00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:22.560
 application services are called inter-autonomous interactions. With individual-oriented PALS in

00:42:22.560 --> 00:42:32.960
 place using OAuth of PALS, resources can be shared. Based on that, we can then structure inter-autonomous

00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:41.760
 interactions while preserving much privacy. Any blueprint for a digital ecosystem must also

00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:49.680
 consider the economic and business dimensions. Chapter 13, Polly Existential Capitalism

00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:58.240
 delves into proper economic models for Polly Existentials. The concept of attribution-based

00:42:58.240 --> 00:43:04.880
 economics, which has been discussed in this forum before, is included.

00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:11.760
 Chapter 21, Private Sector Strategies by Store Open Business Plan

00:43:11.760 --> 00:43:20.720
 deals with the business dimension of PALS. What if, in addition to being ethics-oriented,

00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:27.680
 the entirety of this book could also be considered a sophisticated business plan?

00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:32.160
 Are there any venture capitalists that use EMAX?

00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:40.080
 Here is a set of relatively complete domains and links for digging deeper.

00:43:40.080 --> 00:43:48.640
 These pointers are structured in four layers, ideologies, software, services, and guardianship.

00:43:48.640 --> 00:43:57.280
 If BISOS, by Store Libre Hallol and Polly Existentials have picked your interest,

00:43:57.280 --> 00:44:04.240
 and if you wish to participate in making these ideas more widespread and want to further cultivate

00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:12.160
 them, here are some suggestions. The examples of the bleak concepts that I chose were

00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:21.120
 purposeful and targeted. I'm hopeful that Orgmo developers and EMAX developers would recognize that

00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:27.600
 it makes good sense to expand the scope of Org dynamic blocks to the entirety of EMAX.

00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:35.040
 I'm hopeful that the concept of Polly mode, a single buffer with regions in different modes,

00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:43.360
 and Orgmo in particular, would receive a high priority in our three-seater transition.
