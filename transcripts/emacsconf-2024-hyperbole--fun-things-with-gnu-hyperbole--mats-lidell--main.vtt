00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.920
 Hi, Max conference. I'm Mats Ledele. I'm the maintainer of the Knower Herbperboly together

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:20.360
 with the author Bob Weiner. The title of the talk is "Fun things with Knower Herbperboly".

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:32.320
 And that I intend to cover a different set of small things that is in the package.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:41.080
 So this will not be a tutorial of Herbperboly. For that you have to look for other sources.

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:48.440
 And this is a short talk. So let's get started with the first thing.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:55.400
 Also we're going to talk about scrolling and with the subtitle using the end of line.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:01.960
 If you need to Herbperboly, you need to know about the action key and the assist key.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:08.520
 The action key is bound to meta-return and the assist key is bound by default to meta-return

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:16.040
 with the prefix orbit. So both of these keys are used for performing actions on different

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:26.840
 contexts. And in this case we'll look what happens when you use it on the end of the line.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:38.880
 So I have here the tutorial, the MX tutorial, and we see here a line inserting and deleting.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:45.280
 I move there and put the cursor on the end of the line. I then hit meta-return, the

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:54.880
 action key, and it's moved to the top of the window. If I want to move it to the last row

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:03.360
 on the window, I can press Ctrl U and then meta-return. So I use the assist key.

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:10.760
 If I repeatedly hit meta-return, it will scroll. So the first time it moves to the top of

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:22.880
 the window. But if I add the top of the window, it's meta-return again, it scrolls.

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:34.800
 Now move to the next thing. So the next thing is to compose an email from Manares. Another

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:47.680
 is the style of username at the main. Let's look into that. So here I have entered the file

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:56.360
 in the MX distribution version control EL and at its top it has a lot of different email

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:07.360
 addresses from contributors. This is in principle a normal text file. And by placing the cursor

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:14.880
 over one of these addresses and hitting the action key, I probably identify that it's an

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:26.480
 email address and tries to open or opens the email composo with that using that email address.

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:35.640
 And if we go to the scotch buffer, prepare another name there. So just to demonstrate the

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:49.400
 box in an buffer the same way. The next found thing is insert implicit link. I'm going

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:58.680
 to give you an example with email, I'm to share an implicit link with someone. An implicit

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:05.520
 link is a text pattern, just as we saw with the email address, something that I probably

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:14.480
 recognize is just by how the text looks. So here we have the example. We have started

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:21.560
 writing an email to the user at the main. And in the other window below the cursor control

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:30.760
 EL file is open. It's now opened within the search path, the load path. So that's why

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:40.160
 it's compressed. And I want to tell my friend about the credit section. So first the cursor

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:45.920
 is placed here at your credit section. I move over to another window and I use the hyperbole

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:56.000
 menu system. So by hitting control H, H, I go into the menu system. I press I for getting

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:05.960
 an I button, implicit button, I press L for getting a, creating a link. And there you have

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:14.440
 the link. So what does that link mean? Well, it means that in the low for hyperbole email

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:20.800
 actually finds a special. If there are in the load path, they will use this short format.

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:29.960
 And the end, you have the L for the line number 24 and the C for the column. So if I hit the

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:37.800
 action key on this line, you can see that the cursor moves over to the credit section.

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:46.420
 You can remove that file just to make sure that it works and move the cursor a little bit

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:54.040
 and hit after turning again or meta return and we moved over there. So it, I mean, given

00:05:54.040 --> 00:06:00.560
 that the receiver has a similar setup with emacs, et cetera, they will, that link will

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:08.780
 work there as well. Hi, emacs conference. It's a new recording day. The sun is shining.

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:15.960
 I'm wearing a new t-shirt, but we're still cracking on with fun things in hyperbole.

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:24.640
 Our next subject is window grid. So with hyperbole, it's easy to create a grid of windows.

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:29.800
 I'm going to show how you can do that and also moving on. I'm going to show how you can

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:38.780
 use the red or eye buffer to select what buffers to show in the grid. And I will also show

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:49.120
 how you can save configuration for use later. You reach the window grid functionality

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:58.200
 through the hyperbole menu system. So control H, H, screen. There you have to submenus frame

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:05.040
 control, window control. The red functionality is part of both of these submenus. You can

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:14.120
 select either, but I go with window control here. And down to the left, we see the add character

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:24.000
 and the grid of windows. So hit add. And I'm prompted with the number of columns and rows

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:40.160
 for the window grid, which I select 3 by 3 grid. And we get the 3 by 3 grid. It's populated

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:53.440
 with buffers. I have loaded in emacs. So let's go back to the square buffer. Now using

00:07:53.440 --> 00:08:00.320
 all those keystrokes for the menu system is a little bit cumbersome. So there is a shortcut

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:09.160
 control C at and if I use that control C at, I get immediately prompted with the number

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:21.640
 of rows and columns. If I use a prefix org 0, control U 0, control C at, I get also prompted

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:30.880
 with what type of buffers I want to populate in my grid. So let's select emacs list mode.

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:43.360
 And again with the 3 by 3 grid. And here you see all the grids or the whole grid is populated

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:57.220
 with the emacs list buffers. To get even finer control, you can go into iBuffer and I have

00:08:57.220 --> 00:09:06.640
 pre-selected here all the emacs list files. I have, so let's pick a few like I marked them

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:17.120
 like this. Let's pick three or maybe pick four. And then I had the add sign and then it automatically

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:32.640
 shows tool by tool grid with the selected buffers. We can go in again and maybe maybe select

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:44.380
 a few more. And the same thing hit add and it now becomes a 3 by 2 grid with these buffers.

00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:56.040
 The same thing is possible through the grid. So let's just mark quite a few here and

00:09:56.040 --> 00:10:04.400
 then hit add and then it populates it with all the buffers and you see that if it's not enough

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:16.800
 buffer to fill the whole grid, there are blank grids or tangles in the grid. Now going back

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:25.800
 and forth like this, maybe if you want to work on some file and then go over to dear it again

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:33.040
 to select this can be a little bit cumbersome. You maybe are prepared, agreed with the buffers

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:42.500
 you want to have there. Then the heart probably comes with a simple window configuration support

00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:48.280
 and you reach that the same way through the heart probably menus or controller hh and

00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:59.340
 window w for window and there you can hit save to save the configuration to ring of configurations.

00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:07.540
 So let's go back to like the scratch buffer again here and now we want to sort of bring up

00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:14.500
 our window configuration again so we hit control hh and window and yanking the configuration

00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:23.780
 and boom, there is the grid again. We're reaching the end of the talk. The last fun thing I want

00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:30.200
 to talk about is the heart probably support for select the thing and we'll show some use

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:42.220
 of selections together with web search. So here I have brought up the new general public

00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:50.380
 license for just getting some text that I can show the select the thing functionality. So let's

00:11:50.380 --> 00:12:00.060
 move the cursor over the word versions and then I hit control c return which is bound for the

00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:11.500
 select the thing functionality. Then it selects the word that the cursor was at. If I hit it again

00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:19.900
 control c return it selects the line and again it selects the sentence and again the whole paragraph.

00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:29.980
 So that's a convenient way to extend your search source your selections rather in a buffer.

00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:41.180
 Looking at selection so you can use that from web search. Let's mark some text and then

00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:48.460
 hit control c / which is bound for the web search. Here you see the heart probably menu system

00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:57.980
 again. It's slightly customized with things that I use but the basic menus are the one supported by

00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:08.620
 heart probably. So let's look at searching .go and it then publish the prompt with the selection.

00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:18.780
 And I have configured it so it uses my Firefox for these searches.

00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:30.700
 Here we have the new general public license show. I can also show that for like me being not native

00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:40.300
 English speaker let's look what take away your freedoms means in Swedish so control c / and then

00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:48.380
 I hit translate. Take away your freedom. Yeah what's the translation for that? Using Google translate

00:13:48.380 --> 00:14:00.300
 I get it translated the Swedish. That was the whole talk.

00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:08.860
 We reached the end and thanks for listening. Bye.
