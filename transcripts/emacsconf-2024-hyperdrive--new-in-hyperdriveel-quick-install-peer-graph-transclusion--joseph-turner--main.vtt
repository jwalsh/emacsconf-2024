WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.320
 Hello, welcome to this talk on hyperdrive.el.

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:06.160
 I'm Joseph Turner, presenting on behalf of Ushen,

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:09.600
 a tiny independent information freedom non-profit.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.600
 Hyperdrive.el is an EMAX interface

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.480
 to the Hyperdrive peer-to-peer file sharing system

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:16.800
 built by hole punch.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.320
 Like other peer-to-peer file sharing tools,

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.040
 such as BitTorrent, Hyperdrive lets you

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.720
 share unlimited files directly with other users

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.200
 without having to go through a central hub.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.480
 One thing that sets Hyperdrive apart

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.240
 is that the files you share can be modified.

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.720
 And since Hyperdrive has built-in versioning,

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.720
 you can explore the history of changes

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.800
 that you make to your files or others make to theirs.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.280
 You can stream video and audio.

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.480
 There's no sign-up or account creation process required,

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.600
 and it's all free software.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.240
 This means that the community has the legal right,

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.760
 the tools and the information necessary

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.520
 to participate in the development process,

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.480
 or even fork the project and go simmer-on.

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.360
 Since last year's talk, we've added a few new features.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.160
 It's now much easier to get started using Hyperdrive.el

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.480
 since we added the Hyperdrive install command,

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.600
 which downloads the gateway program

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.920
 and installs it on your machine.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.120
 We added a peer-graph feature, which

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:22.560
 lets you visualize your network of sources of information.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.440
 We also published a new package, Hyperdrive,

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.480
 Org Transclusion, which lets you display

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:34.560
 live updating snippets of Hyperdrive files in Org documents.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:35.840
 Let's get started.

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.280
 Let's say you get an email from your friend, Alice,

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.080
 inviting you to check out Hyperdrive.el.

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.280
 Let's click on the link here to look at the manual.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.120
 Let's go down to the installation section.

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:53.880
 So it says you need to have GNU EMAX version 28.1 or later.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.600
 I'll assume you have it installed, but if not,

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.480
 you can click this link.

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.440
 You need to have curl installed, which is likely already

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.680
 the case, but if not, Hyperdrive.el will let you know.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.320
 Now, from within EMAX, you can install Hyperdrive.el.

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:14.440
 Run meta-x, package, refresh contents.

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:20.800
 Then meta-x, package install, type in Hyperdrive,

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.120
 and hit return.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.080
 Next, we'll install Hyper Gateway Usher.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:31.680
 Let's run meta-x, Hyperdrive install.

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.600
 It's prompting me to download and install the gateway,

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:35.920
 which is 51 megabytes.

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:43.520
 I'll press Y, and I will skip most of the download process.

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:44.760
 The download is wrapping up.

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.160
 Now, it's prompting me to start the gateway.

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.840
 I can other run meta-x, Hyperdrive start,

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.240
 or I can press this button.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:03.560
 And after a few moments, we'll see that the gateway will start.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:04.760
 It's ready.

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.640
 You can also click this button, view Hyperdrive user

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.840
 info manual, to view the same manual

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.920
 that we were viewing in the browser.

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.920
 The info manual comes with Hyperdrive.el

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.000
 and is available offline.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.200
 Now that everything's installed and the gateway is running,

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.280
 we're back at Alice's email.

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.000
 Let's click on the link to her Hyperdrive.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.960
 Here's Alice's Hyperdrive.

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:29.840
 Let's open her hello.org file.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:36.800
 I'm being prompted to mark Alice's Hyperdrive.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.080
 Currently, it's unknown.

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.880
 I'll press question mark to see more details.

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:47.680
 Safe, unsafe, unknown, I'll press E for explain.

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.640
 In the info manual, it says that if a Hyperdrive

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:56.720
 is marked as safe, that means files in that Hyperdrive

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:00.280
 will automatically have their major mode enabled

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.480
 based on their file extension.

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:06.160
 In this case, if I mark Alice's Hyperdrive as safe,

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:10.120
 and I click on this hello.org file, Emax will automatically

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.360
 enable org mode in that file.

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:17.320
 Since I know Alice directly, I'll mark her Hyperdrive as safe.

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.280
 I'll click on the file hello.org again,

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:25.600
 and now I'll press shift S for safe.

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.160
 Now I'm going to set Alice's pet name.

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:33.320
 Hyperdrive.el has different ways to name a Hyperdrive.

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:37.120
 The public key is the drive's unique identifier.

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.200
 You can also assign yourself a public nickname, which

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.840
 you announce to the world.

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.880
 Then users on their own machines can assign each Hyperdrive

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:49.120
 that they are aware of a private pet name.

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.800
 So I'll assign Alice a pet name, which

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:56.200
 is the way that I will identify Alice just on my own machine.

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.920
 I'll type in my friend Alice.

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:03.880
 Then when I refresh her drive, we

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:07.400
 see that it says pet name in the top left.

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:11.440
 Now I'll do what she asks, which is to right click on her name

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.240
 and open her peer graph.

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:17.000
 In the context menu, I see a few different actions I can take,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.200
 but I'll click on peer graph.

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:22.560
 It's prompting me to pick the max hops for sources.

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:23.720
 Default three.

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.080
 I'll choose the default.

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:26.200
 Same for blockers.

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:27.680
 I'll explain what that means later.

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:33.760
 This is Alice's peer graph.

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:39.160
 Here, we can see that Alice has two direct sources, Bob and Eve.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:42.600
 Both Bob and Eve have assigned themselves nicknames.

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:45.200
 And so we see Bob and Eve here.

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:50.080
 Eve has assigned this other Hyperdrive to be a source.

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:57.120
 But this other Hyperdrive, whose public key is kb3zr6mq and so on,

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:59.000
 if we hover over the Hyperdrive, we'll

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.800
 see the full public key, has not assigned itself a nickname.

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:07.560
 And so we just see the truncated short public key.

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:10.920
 Because we've assigned a pet name for Alice,

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:14.520
 we see Alice's pet name show up here.

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:18.520
 Now I'll open the peer list view to show the same information

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:20.320
 in a different way.

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:24.000
 Since I'm using a large font, I'll widen this window

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
 so we can see everything going on in the peer list.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.200
 We see that the root Hyperdrive is pet name, my friend Alice,

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:34.800
 nickname Alice, public key DM1 and so on.

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:38.160
 We've set the sources max hops to three, which

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:41.960
 means that we will go out at most three hops from Alice

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:44.200
 in order to find sources.

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:49.240
 So one hop from Alice, our Bob and Eve.

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:55.320
 One hop from Eve is kb3, which is two hops from Alice.

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:58.200
 Now we've set the max hops for sources to three.

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:00.760
 But in this case, the network is small.

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:03.000
 And kb3 has no sources.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.640
 And so we can only go out two hops from Alice

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:07.800
 until we run out of sources.

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:10.160
 In the future, we plan to add a search feature

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.280
 based on this list of sources.

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:14.920
 You type in a query, and you get back a list of results

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:18.680
 published by Eve, Bob, or kb3.

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:21.200
 It's also possible to block peers.

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:25.640
 I'll open the transient menu by pressing question mark.

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:29.760
 For now, let's turn on showing blocked peers.

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:35.440
 So I'll press S, X, and now it says blocked sources.

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:37.880
 Now we can see Mallory also shows up.

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:40.840
 Mallory has been included as a source by Eve,

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:42.600
 but is blocked.

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:45.120
 And so in the end result, she does not show up

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:46.640
 in the list of sources.

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:49.960
 Instead, she shows up as a blocked source.

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:53.640
 But how is it that Mallory ended up being blocked?

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:56.240
 Let's open up the transient menu once more,

00:07:56.240 --> 00:08:01.880
 and click S, B to show blockers.

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:05.600
 Now we can see that Bob has blocked Mallory.

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:09.440
 This means that Bob is not interested in seeing search

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:12.200
 results from Mallory.

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:16.240
 Since Alice has included Bob as a blocker,

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:22.120
 that means that Alice trusts Bob to block people on her behalf.

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:25.040
 And so since Bob has blocked Mallory,

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:30.000
 Mallory does not show up in Alice's peer graph as a source.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.120
 Well, now I'm curious to see what it is Mallory published

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:35.440
 that drove Bob to block her.

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:37.440
 So I'll right click on Mallory.

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:41.160
 And in the context menu, open hyperdrive.

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:45.560
 And wingsuit flying grand canyon point of view, not clickbait.

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:46.560
 I got to check this out.

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:51.520
 No.

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:53.160
 Disgusting.

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:55.880
 No wonder Bob blocked Mallory.

00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:59.600
 Let's go back to Alice's peer graph.

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:02.520
 So Mallory is a blocked source.

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:06.520
 Are there any peers who are blocked, but who aren't sources?

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:11.560
 I'll open the transient menu, and I'll press S, X.

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:15.200
 Now we're looking at blocked non-sources.

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:17.960
 Darth, who's been blocked by Bob,

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:21.840
 has not been added by any of Alice's sources as a source.

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:25.160
 And so Darth is a blocked non-source.

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:29.400
 I'll open the transient menu again, and I'll press S, X.

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:33.120
 And now we're looking at all blocked peers.

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:35.680
 So both Mallory and Darth show up.

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:37.160
 If I scroll down in the peer list,

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:40.440
 we'll see that Mallory is listed under blocked sources.

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:44.240
 And Darth is listed under blocked non-sources.

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:46.360
 This view has gotten a little bit busy.

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:49.640
 Let's say that we're only interested in how Alice

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:51.640
 relates to Mallory.

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:54.160
 So I'll open the transient menu,

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:59.080
 and I will filter the graph to show paths only to Mallory.

00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:04.360
 I'll press O, A, type in Mallory, and hit Enter.

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:08.320
 And now we see that Mallory has a bold border.

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:12.720
 And KB3 and Darth are missing from the graph.

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:16.840
 Eves shows up because there is a path from Alice

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:21.680
 to Mallory that goes through E, same for Bob.

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:26.680
 We can also add more than one peer in this view.

00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:29.280
 So I'll press O, A again.

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:32.880
 And this time I'll choose Darth.

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:35.400
 Now Darth and Mallory have bold borders,

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:37.640
 and KB3 is still missing.

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:41.120
 We can remove Mallory and Darth one at a time with O, R,

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:45.360
 or we can press Ctrl U, the universal prefix argument,

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:50.240
 and then O, R to remove both Mallory and Darth from the list.

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:53.200
 Now we're back to seeing everybody.

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:56.000
 This view of the graph is somewhat simplified

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.200
 because we're showing only the shortest paths between peers.

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:06.120
 If I press Shift S, now we're looking at all paths.

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:08.760
 And here we can see that in addition

00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:12.720
 to going from Alice to Bob as a source directly,

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:19.240
 we also go from Alice to Bob through E, as a source.

00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:23.800
 Let's go back to showing only the shortest paths.

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:27.960
 Currently, the max hops for sources and for blockers

00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:29.440
 is set to three.

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:35.800
 Let's see what happens if we set the blockers max hops to zero.

00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:38.600
 So after the graph reloads, we now see

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:43.120
 that Mallory shows up as a source, not as a blocked source.

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:47.640
 And this is because Bob, who is one hop away from Alice,

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:50.120
 is no longer included as a blocker,

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:53.240
 because we've set the blockers max hops to zero.

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:55.640
 And since Bob is not a blocker, the fact

00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:59.160
 that Bob blocks Mallory doesn't factor in.

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:02.560
 While Alice is the only one who gets to decide who

00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:06.600
 her direct sources, blockers, and blocked peers are,

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:10.080
 anyone can view Alice's paragraph, tinker

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:12.680
 with the sources or blockers max hops,

00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:16.880
 and use her list of sources to do a search.

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:22.520
 Let's see what happens if we set sources max hops to two.

00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:25.280
 Well, the graph doesn't change because we only ever went out

00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:27.280
 two hops anyway.

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:30.560
 Let's set sources max hops to one.

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:35.440
 And now we only see Bob and Eve, since KB3 and Mallory

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:37.920
 are two hops out.

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:40.560
 Source hops zero.

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:44.360
 And now we're left with just Alice.

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:47.880
 Now I'd like to create a new hyperdrive and add Alice

00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:49.320
 as a source.

00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:52.720
 I'll run MetaX hyperdrive new.

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:55.800
 Now it's prompting me for a new hyperdrive seed.

00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:58.000
 Seed is the string of characters that's

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.640
 combined with your secret key, which

00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:03.360
 is generated for you by the gateway program,

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:08.000
 in order to create a new public key for this new hyperdrive.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.080
 I'll type in Joseph, a new drive.

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:15.080
 Now I'll right click on my own name.

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:20.280
 And in the context menu, I'll choose set relation from.

00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:30.280
 From Joseph to Alice as a source.

00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:32.760
 Now I'll right click on my name again

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:36.040
 and click on pier graph.

00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:40.520
 Max hops, let's say three.

00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:41.920
 And for blockers as well.

00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:50.120
 And here's the pier graph from my newly created hyperdrive's

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:52.800
 perspective.

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:55.040
 Mallory is included as a source.

00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:57.400
 Three hops from the root.

00:13:57.400 --> 00:13:58.600
 Let's open the list view.

00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:06.080
 If we were to mark Alice as a blocker by clicking

00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:09.720
 on this button in the blocker column next to the pet name

00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:14.560
 for Alice, then we see that Mallory shows up

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:16.640
 as a blocked source.

00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:20.560
 Only now that Joseph includes Alice as a blocker

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:25.600
 does the fact that Bob blocked Mallory take effect.

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:28.360
 You can click on another pier to set them

00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:30.200
 as the root hyperdrive.

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:32.840
 I'll click on eith.

00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:36.760
 Now we're looking at the pier graph from eith's perspective.

00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:39.240
 This pier graph view has a history.

00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:41.080
 If I open the transient menu, you'll

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:43.520
 see here there's a back and a forward button.

00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:46.480
 Back is bound to L for left.

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:50.480
 If I press L, we're looking at the graph from Joseph's

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:51.640
 perspective.

00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:57.280
 If I press L again, now we're looking at Alice as at the beginning.

00:14:57.280 --> 00:15:01.080
 I'll press R to go forward, and R again,

00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:03.280
 and now we're back at eith.

00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:06.040
 Now I'd like to show you the hyperdrive org

00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:08.320
 transclusion package we published.

00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:09.920
 I'll open up the hyperdrive manual

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:11.040
 to see how to install it.

00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:20.560
 Now from here, I'll press M and type in Transclusion

00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:23.160
 to jump straight to the org transclusion integration

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:25.040
 section of the manual.

00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:28.200
 To summarize, we can install hyperdrive org transclusion

00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:34.000
 with MetaX, package install, hyperdrive org transclusion.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:43.800
 Then, once this is done, we will copy the following snippet

00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:46.280
 and add it either to our init.el file,

00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:50.120
 or in this case, I'll just evaluate it.

00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:52.920
 Now, hyperdrive org transclusion mode is enabled.

00:15:52.920 --> 00:16:02.240
 Let's go back to the Hello.org file in Alice's hyperdrive.

00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:06.920
 I'll right-click on Alice, then click Open Hyperdrive,

00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:09.400
 and hit Enter on Hello.org.

00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:12.440
 This time, I'm not prompted to mark Alice's hyperdrive

00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:16.080
 as safe since we did it already.

00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:20.240
 I'll navigate to the checkout My Piers heading,

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:26.600
 then I'll run MetaX, org store link.

00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:29.800
 Now, I'll create a new file in my hyperdrive

00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:34.160
 by running MetaX, hyperdrive find file.

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:38.480
 I'll select my hyperdrive, and I'll call this new file

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:46.440
 response to Alice.org.

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:50.960
 Now, I'll paste in a response that I've written.

00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:58.120
 I'll go to the bottom, and I will run MetaX, org insert link,

00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:02.480
 and I'll insert the link that I stored earlier.

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:12.960
 As the link description, I'll change it to SNIP it from Alice's hyperdrive file.

00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:18.680
 And I'll save my hyperdrive file.

00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:24.120
 Now, to show that the link works, I'll just kill this buffer showing the Hello.org file,

00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:27.400
 and I'll click on the link.

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:31.520
 Now, in addition to linking from my file to the heading in Alice's file,

00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:35.680
 I'd like to transclude this heading's content in my file.

00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:45.440
 So I'll go to the link in my file, and run MetaX, org transclusion make from link.

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:48.000
 And I'll save my file again.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:54.480
 All that's been added is another link prefixed with this transclude keyword.

00:17:54.480 --> 00:18:01.880
 To make the transclusion show up in line, I'll run MetaX, org transclusion add.

00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:06.840
 The content of Alice's file hasn't been copied into mind, it's just being transcluded.

00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:15.360
 So if I run MetaX, org transclusion, remove, you'll see that the underlying content is still

00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:21.800
 just the transclude keyword and the link.

00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:26.440
 Now, some time has passed and Alice has updated her hyperdrive file.

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:29.840
 She wrote, "Please add me as a source.

00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:34.700
 Since the transclude link that I added in my file does not specify a version, it will

00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:39.600
 always transclude the latest version of Alice's Hello.org file.

00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:46.040
 So if I run MetaX, org transclusion add once more, we'll see that the latest version

00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:50.920
 of Alice's file gets transcluded into mind.

00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:55.840
 Let's say that I want to transclude the previous version of Alice's Hello.org file.

00:18:55.840 --> 00:19:00.600
 And I don't want my transclusion to change when Alice updates her file.

00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:01.600
 That's possible too.

00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:09.640
 I'll go over to her file and run MetaX, hyperdrive, open previous version.

00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:15.160
 Now when I widen the window a little, we can see in the mode line that this is version

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:21.440
 57. For an explanation of what the version numbers mean, check out the last video or the

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:23.080
 info manual.

00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:31.880
 For now, I'll go down to her checkout my peers heading and run MetaX, org store link.

00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:37.360
 Now in my response to Alice, I'll insert the link.

00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:41.920
 I'll run org transclusion make from link.

00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:44.080
 And now there are two transclusions.

00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:49.720
 The first transclusion will update whenever Alice updates her file and the second transclusion

00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:52.880
 is pinned to version 57.

00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:58.400
 That covers hyperdrive install, the peer graph, and hyperdrive org transclusion.

00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:04.160
 Feel free to check out the hyperdrive.el info manual in the ush and hyperdrive here, or

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:06.400
 on the ush.org website.

00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:11.680
 Thanks to the folks at Supranica, we have a public xmpp group chat you can join either using

00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:15.600
 an xmpp client or anonymously from your browser.

00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:18.560
 If you use matrix, there's also a bridge.

00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:23.000
 Thank you for watching, and thank you to the EMAX comp organizers and all the presenters

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:24.760
 who made this wonderful event possible.
