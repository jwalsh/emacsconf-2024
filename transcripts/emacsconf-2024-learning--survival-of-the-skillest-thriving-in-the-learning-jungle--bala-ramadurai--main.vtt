00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.200
 Oh wow, I am going to tell you about how I am learning this new thing.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:15.500
 Okay, dude, I am recording, okay, so I will call you back.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.500
 Yeah, yeah, I am doing learning the new thing.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.500
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, later, later, later.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.500
 Not right now, later, later, later, later.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.000
 Sorry about that.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.800
 Okay, as I was saying, I am going to tell you all about how I am learning this.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.800
 New thing.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.300
 Ooh, such a Chua's Emacs newsletter is out.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.800
 Maybe I should spend some time.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.800
 Wait a second, I have to learn this new thing.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:56.800
 Okay, so I am going to tell you how we can learn new skills in the middle of so many other wonderful things that you want to do and to speak to wonderful people that you would speak to.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:04.300
 My name is Bala Ramadurai and I am going to be talking about the survival of the skill list.

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.300
 That's what I call it, okay.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.800
 Survey of the skill list, learning or thriving in the learning jungle.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:17.800
 Here, I am going to give you some tips and techniques as to how you can learn skills, new skills.

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:27.800
 I am going to give you a quote from a multi-talented teacher. It was the second president of my country, India.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.800
 As Radhakshan, he says, "When we think we know, we cease to learn."

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.800
 That was his quote.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.800
 What is the skill?

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:42.800
 The skill is the knowledge and the ability that enables you to do something well.

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.800
 That's the knowledge, first and the ability and you have to do it well, right.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.800
 So, why should you learn a new skill?

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:57.800
 Now, if you can pause this video watching streaming part of the video, then come up with your own reasons.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.800
 I am going to give you my top three reasons that you might want to learn a new skill.

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.800
 Get ahead in your career.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:10.800
 Look good or cool in your community or peer group or someone forced you to.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.800
 Now, what skills should you learn?

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.800
 There could be a whole list.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:25.800
 Let me take a stab at some of the ones that I think could be cool, bunch of jumping, teaching your pet to pick up the newspaper without tearing it to shreds.

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.800
 Perhaps with Python rearing, I mean coding, coding, you can do learning coding.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.800
 So, you could list your own skills that you have to learn, you want to learn.

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.800
 But what stops you from learning new skills?

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.800
 The most common reason that I've heard in the past is lack of time.

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.800
 Oh, Bala, I have to do so many things.

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.800
 I don't have the time to learn any new skills.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.800
 Like a motivation could be another reason.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:56.800
 Or you just are rebel, I don't know who is he or who is he to tell me what I should learn.

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:57.800
 I'm going to learn things like that.

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.800
 So, then stops you from learning a new skill.

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:06.800
 But there's even more fundamental reason for why we don't learn a new skill so easily.

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.800
 And this comes from this story of scholar in the T cup.

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.800
 I can pass on the link later to you.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.800
 You can watch this, my own version of this story.

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:23.800
 The ultimate truth in this story or the moral in this story is that we are filled with preconceived ideas.

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.800
 And the Zen Master in the story says, it's like a full T cup.

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.800
 You want to learn new skills, you have to empty your T cup.

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.800
 Now, how do you empty your T cup?

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.800
 You just can't pour everything out of your head.

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.800
 So, how do you really empty your T cup?

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:48.800
 So, the way to empty your T cup, simplest way to do it is write down your thoughts as simple as that.

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.800
 Just take a piece of paper and write it down.

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:58.800
 Or, if you want electronic means, use emacs or mode and type out your thoughts.

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.800
 They'll task for you right now.

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:06.800
 What you have to do is to create a folder in your documents, folder called inbox, create one.

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.800
 And create a new file called to do.org.

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:14.800
 If you are paper based, you can use a notebook or any other forms of the same file.

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:19.800
 In that, write down all your unfinished tasks, personal and professional.

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:22.800
 Write down some things that have been worrying you.

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.800
 Whatever worries you right now, just write it down.

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:26.800
 The whole thing.

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.800
 Write down some tasks or actions that you are waiting for someone else.

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.800
 Somebody else that could also be part of your list here.

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:35.800
 Great.

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.800
 Now, that empty your T cup, I am going to tell you the origin of these ideas.

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.800
 These come from getting things done by David Allen.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:43.800
 It's a great book.

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:44.800
 I've read it multiple times.

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:45.800
 Fantastic.

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:51.800
 And he says, your mind is for having ideas, not holding them.

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:56.800
 You have to hold on to this idea in your mind.

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.800
 Keep it in your mind saying it's for having ideas, not holding them.

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:01.800
 All right.

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.800
 Perform one of four actions on your task list.

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:05.800
 Okay.

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.800
 The one that you just wrote down.

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:08.800
 You delete them.

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:09.800
 Okay.

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:10.800
 As simple as that.

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:11.800
 Strike through the task.

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:15.800
 Hit the delete or change the state to cancel.

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:16.800
 Okay.

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:17.800
 All right.

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.800
 If you don't want to delete it, you want to defer it.

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.800
 Add it to your calendar.

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.800
 Add a reminder to it if you want.

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:29.800
 Or in Emacs org mode, use Ctrl+C, Ctrl+S to schedule it to a different time.

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.800
 That you feel you would be able to do that task.

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:34.800
 Or just delegate it to somebody else.

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:39.800
 Maybe you are not the best person to do it or you probably won't find time to do this.

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.800
 Send it to your colleague, student, assistant.

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:46.800
 Maybe even your favorite LLM to do this.

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.800
 LLM being large language model.

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.800
 Or just do it.

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.800
 As they say, just do it.

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.800
 Set a timer for two minutes and do the task.

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.800
 Finish the task right here right now.

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:58.800
 Nothing stopping you.

00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:59.800
 Finish it.

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:00.800
 Oh, great.

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:01.800
 I'm going to do this.

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:04.800
 But set yourself two minutes because sometimes it may spill over to half an hour.

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.800
 And you still haven't processed the real list.

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.800
 That's why there's a timer for two minutes.

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:13.800
 One tip I'm going to give you is don't skip any of the items from your list.

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:15.800
 Because it's tougher.

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:16.800
 You've been trying to avoid it.

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:17.800
 Don't do that.

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:20.800
 Be rigorous and finish it off.

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:22.800
 Processing at least.

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:26.800
 Now you can do the absolute same process on your email inbox.

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:27.800
 I know.

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:31.800
 I know some of you have 55,000 emails in your inbox.

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:33.800
 How am I going to process all of them?

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:38.800
 Well, Tiago Forte whose method I'm going to be also talking about says.

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:42.800
 Archive them all and pull out the top 100.

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:45.800
 The last latest 100 and process that.

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:47.800
 That's a cool way to do it.

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:48.800
 Okay.

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:52.800
 So you're not stuck to those 50,000 but just the top 100 of those.

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:57.800
 You can do the same absolutely the same thing to any of your messaging apps as well.

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:01.800
 WhatsApp, Matrix, Slack, whatever you choose.

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:04.800
 Even to your physical inbox, you can do the absolute same things.

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:08.800
 Put your items and see if you can need to process them.

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:09.800
 Okay.

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:14.800
 What if the email or message or task is something that you might need in the future?

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:15.800
 Great.

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:19.800
 Archive them or move it to a place you may refer to later.

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:25.800
 So you have plenty of storage in your cloud space, in your email space, in your computer space.

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:26.800
 Use that.

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:27.800
 You know, Archive it.

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:28.800
 You can refer to it later.

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:29.800
 Not over it.

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:30.800
 Don't want it right in front of you.

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:32.800
 That's the only thing here.

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:38.800
 Now another question that pops you ahead is what if something that requires multiple steps, right?

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:40.800
 Not all steps are created.

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:42.800
 Not all tasks are created alike.

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:44.800
 You have multiple steps to the task.

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:46.800
 That's when the task becomes a project.

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:47.800
 Okay.

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:53.800
 An example or a few examples of those are finishing a course on say Courser or NPTEL or UDME.

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:57.800
 Teaching of course, if you're a teacher in your college or school.

00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:01.800
 If you're organizing a conference such as the EMAX conference.

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:03.800
 It's a huge project.

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:09.800
 You will need to use, it's a project, arranging a birthday party for your spouse.

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:11.800
 That's sweet, but it's still a project.

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:12.800
 You will have many tasks in it.

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:14.800
 So these are examples of projects.

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:17.800
 Here's how one can handle projects.

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:19.800
 Create a folder for each project.

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:22.800
 Create a text or word doc or title.

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:25.800
 It has to do.text or to do.docx or to do.docx or to do.docx.

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:28.800
 I prefer.docx and you can do it.

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:34.800
 And in that, write down the success criteria, the goal or the deadline of the project.

00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:37.800
 Write down all the tasks that need to be done.

00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:39.800
 You don't have to think about all of it.

00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:45.800
 But whatever comes to your mind, just put it in there as some tasks that you need to get done inside this project.

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:53.800
 Now, write, identify the immediate action that needs to be done for the project to move forward.

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:56.800
 That's usually something that's stopping the project from progressing.

00:08:56.800 --> 00:09:00.800
 So identify that and say, that's the next thing I'm going to do.

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:03.800
 An example of a project is right here.

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:08.800
 The goal of the project is to deliver a talk about my organizing system, organization system.

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:12.800
 Make it like a workshop for pa and with pauses for activities.

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:15.800
 You can see that this is the talk that I'm delivering right now.

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:18.800
 And right now, if you see, recording the talk.

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:24.800
 Of course, the next one I'm going to do after this is going to be sending the recorded talk the file and the PDF for the talk.

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:28.800
 Now, if you want, you can add some sub steps and all that also into this.

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:34.800
 Of course, I'd like to thank the coordinators for their absolutely wonderful work that they're doing throughout this.

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:36.800
 Now, task for you.

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:42.800
 You can take your time and first of all, think of a project that you have to get absolutely get done.

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:49.800
 Create a project, sorry, create a folder on your computer or phone with the name of the project.

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:53.800
 Create a to do dot org.

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:56.800
 If you want to use a notebook, you can use a fresh leaf.

00:09:56.800 --> 00:10:00.800
 Write down the tasks, all the tasks associated with this project.

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:02.800
 That's going to be how you handle it.

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:04.800
 Now, what if you have multiple projects?

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:07.800
 Not many of us have only one project.

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:09.800
 In fact, many of us have multiple projects.

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:11.800
 What do we do in that situation?

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:13.800
 Well, the answer is simple.

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:15.800
 Create a folder for each project.

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:25.800
 Add this org file called to do into each of those folders and write down the tasks for all of these projects as well.

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:28.800
 Write down all of the tasks and mark one of them as next.

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:30.800
 There can be only one next action.

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:32.800
 It can't be multiple next action.

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:37.800
 That's the immediate thing that has to be done to take this project forward.

00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:40.800
 What are the project stops before completion?

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:41.800
 There are possibilities.

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:42.800
 Sometimes you lose interest.

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:44.800
 Sometimes the collaborator loses interest.

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:46.800
 What do you do in those situations?

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:51.800
 Have a folder in your computer or phone for abandoned projects called resources.

00:10:51.800 --> 00:11:01.800
 Oh, by the way, for your project's folder, create an overarching project's folder and inside that are all the project folders.

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:03.800
 I forgot to tell you that.

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:06.800
 Same way, on the same level, create a resources folder.

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:12.800
 That's for all your abandoned projects or even could be even your research material as well,

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:14.800
 which you're not currently working on.

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:20.800
 Move this particular project that's abandoned or stopped somewhere in between to that folder.

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:23.800
 Now, there's a possibility you might successfully come to.

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:26.800
 I hope your all your projects end up being successful.

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:32.800
 But there are quite a few which will end up in this where quite a few which will end up in the abandoned as well.

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:36.800
 Now, I write an end report so that I can learn from this.

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:38.800
 What did I enjoy most in the project?

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:40.800
 What could have been better?

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:43.800
 What did I learn from this particular project?

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:47.800
 Now, you will need to move that folder to folder called archives.

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:51.800
 This is the final resting place for the project, completed projects.

00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:56.800
 Because if you come up with another project which sounds similar to the archives one,

00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:58.800
 you can pick that out and create that as a template.

00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:00.800
 Use that as a template.

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:07.800
 Now, why would I have one folder per project when there's only one file sitting in it like call to do dot R?

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:13.800
 Well, most projects also have some project files and this folder can be a storehouse of all of that.

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:15.800
 And you can access all of them at one shot.

00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:17.800
 That's the advantage.

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:23.800
 What if the project is ongoing and doesn't really end that doesn't seem to have a deadline or an ending point?

00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:25.800
 That's called an area.

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:27.800
 This is now an area.

00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:31.800
 Examples of areas, gardening, paying bills, never stops.

00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:39.800
 Blogging, these are all some examples of areas that really don't have a definite deadline.

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:43.800
 For areas also, create a folder for each of them.

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:50.800
 You can create a parent folder called areas and under them you can have those areas.

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:53.800
 And have a to do in each of those folders.

00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:56.800
 Now, what do we forget to visit the to do files?

00:12:56.800 --> 00:13:03.800
 Which in my case often happens, I forget to visit those to do files and see what the task needs to be done.

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:10.800
 You can of course, or add all of this to do dot org and into your org agenda files variable.

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:14.800
 So that when you pull up your org agenda, all of them show up.

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:15.800
 That's a good area.

00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:18.800
 You need to have a weekly review with yourself.

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:26.800
 Now, weekly review is essentially a weekly appointment with yourself for you to stay in control of your life or career.

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:28.800
 To keep things in track, on track.

00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:32.800
 In the weekly review, you need to empty your T cup.

00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:34.800
 That's the first and foremost.

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:38.800
 Then process all your items in the to do file.

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:41.800
 Process all your emails from the last week.

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:44.800
 Use the exact same structure or do delete, defer delegate.

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:47.800
 This is the four days that you can use.

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:51.800
 Process all your messaging app messages from the last week.

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:56.800
 So last one whole week, whatever has come up, you need to process all of them.

00:13:56.800 --> 00:14:03.800
 In the weekly review, you also need to archive all your emails and messaging app messages that you have processed.

00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:05.800
 You've already taken care of it.

00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:07.800
 You don't need to have it right in front of you.

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:09.800
 You can move them all into archive.

00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:14.800
 Most messaging apps and email systems have archives as part of their features.

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:19.800
 Look through the project to do files to see if the next action is marked.

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:25.800
 Now, look through the project folder list to see if some of them need to be archived or move to resources.

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:27.800
 Some may be abandoned, some may be done.

00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:32.800
 You can move them successfully to all of where it needs to belong.

00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:33.800
 Now, task for you.

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:35.800
 You can pause this of course and do this.

00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:41.800
 Set an appointment with yourself, sacrifice time with only with yourself and title it weekly review.

00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:43.800
 Start with half an hour.

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:45.800
 Perhaps you can have it longer later on.

00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:49.800
 As you need more time, you can have more time with yourself.

00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:52.800
 And make it repeating every week.

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:54.800
 Now, you can complain.

00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:55.800
 I can hear some of you complain.

00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:58.800
 Oh, this is such a microscopic view of my life.

00:14:58.800 --> 00:14:59.800
 What about the big picture?

00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:01.800
 Well, there is quarterly review.

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:10.800
 Once every 13 weeks, you can mark an appointment with yourself right after your weekly review to do your quarterly review.

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:18.800
 And also, every year, mark yourself, it could be at the start of the end of an academic year or a calendar year.

00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:22.800
 Mark yourself an appointment again with yourself called yearly review.

00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:26.800
 And this contains some big life questions.

00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:32.800
 Now, I will give you some examples, but feel free to modify it, have it as your own.

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:34.800
 How much money did I make?

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:36.800
 How much money did I save?

00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:38.800
 And how many people did I help?

00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:42.800
 How many do I plan to help in the future?

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:44.800
 What projects did I enjoy?

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:47.800
 Look through your archives and resources.

00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:49.800
 Which one didn't I, are best avoided?

00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:51.800
 I don't want to get on to this.

00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:59.800
 Okay, or you can look through your personal and private, I'm sorry, personal and professional and see how much is there a balance between all of this.

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:02.800
 These are some questions you can answer.

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:09.800
 Now that you know how to manage the now, so far we have looked at the now, how do you plan for the future, like really into the future?

00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:12.800
 Well, I have a trick called nine windows for you.

00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:17.800
 Nine windows are essentially the, it's like a tic-tac-toe grid.

00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:24.800
 And the left one is the left column is your past.

00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:30.800
 The middle column is your present and the right column is your future.

00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:37.800
 Okay, and the bottom row is your skill set.

00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:40.800
 The middle row is what you do, what you do.

00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:46.800
 And the top row is whom do you work for or whom do you serve, right?

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:50.800
 So you are doing something for an organization.

00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:52.800
 So those could be in your top row.

00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:55.800
 Let me give an example from my own life.

00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:58.800
 This I made about 10 years ago.

00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:05.800
 Okay, so the middle column is the, what I did 10 years ago.

00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:08.800
 So that is the now, let's keep it as the now.

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:12.800
 Okay, so five years before that, I used to work for General Electric GE.

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:14.800
 I was a research scientist for them.

00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:21.800
 And the skills that I had was, I had a PhD for you, which you was used in this profession.

00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:24.800
 I had writing skills, I had some speaking skills.

00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:28.800
 And I love to interact and learn from my teammates.

00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:35.800
 Then I'll join my tree, which was the current job when I did this software services company.

00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:40.800
 I co-founded Tris India also, these are two organizations that I served.

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:44.800
 And facilitator, that was the main profession that I was in.

00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:51.800
 And the skills I had was Tris, people interacting with people outside of my team.

00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:54.800
 And I could align well with my organization.

00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:58.800
 I knew exactly where they were going and how to align myself, my goals with that.

00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:04.800
 Now, I said five years later, I want to be an entrepreneur and an author.

00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:11.800
 And I want to do this for, I want to really work with academia and corporate companies.

00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:12.800
 That was my goal.

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:19.800
 So the skills I needed to have were marketing, writing, sales, hiring, people management, all of that I needed to have.

00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:20.800
 And I had to plan that.

00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:28.800
 So I used the para structure to manage how I'm going to learn all of these skills and invite those and get better at it.

00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:30.800
 So that's where I used this.

00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:36.800
 Okay, you're done, you can pause this video and build your own nine windows to plan for the future.

00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:42.800
 So in summary, you need to empty your teacup before engaging with the work in front of you.

00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:48.800
 Use the para structure, projects, area, resources and archives, create this folder structure.

00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:53.800
 And use reviews regularly, weekly, quarterly and yearly.

00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:56.800
 Use the nine windows to your advantage for your future career planning.

00:18:56.800 --> 00:19:01.800
 And of course, apply para to your future plans to plan for those as well.

00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:12.800
 Okay, now these are the references I've used heavily borrowed up on Tiago for this para, David Allen's getting things done and Thashin's way to implement this in a maximum hormone.

00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:14.800
 These are some acknowledgments.

00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:17.800
 I use some generative AI for this.

00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:19.800
 And this is a question to you.

00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:21.800
 What parts of this talk?

00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:23.800
 Talk, are you planning on implementing?

00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:25.800
 Please write this in the ether pad.

00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:26.800
 Thank you so much.

00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:30.800
 If you have any questions, let me know in the ether pad as well.

00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:36.800
 Good luck managing your tasks, emptying your teacup and planning for the future.

00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:45.800
