00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:03.800
 Hello, my name is Abhinav and I'm going to talk about unlocking

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.600
 link data in org mode.

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.500
 So like a lot of you, I use Emacs on org mode for keeping a lot

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.800
 of my data, personal information.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:15.200
 For example, if I'm trying to write journal entries,

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.800
 it's most likely going to be an org mode file.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.000
 If I'm trying to save bookmarks or save links,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.520
 I again, they go into an org mode file.

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.800
 Now, I was doing that earlier, but last year,

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.360
 I think around last year, I started to use

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.240
 these specialized applications.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.960
 So for example, if I'm trying to save bookmarks,

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.000
 I'm going to use a bookmark manager.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.800
 I specifically was using drain drop for that.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.520
 What happened with that is that it allowed me to save bookmarks.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.040
 Let's say, when I'm on Go, I'm on a mobile phone.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.400
 I can just open my Android app and then save links to it.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.000
 I can also annotate and do other things

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.880
 that you can do on bookmarks.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.600
 Similarly, for reading, let's say, papers and periods,

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.720
 I would use that arrow for keeping notes about people.

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.200
 I'll use a tool called Monika CRM.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.400
 Now, all these tools, the aim is to do one thing really well,

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.480
 but they kind of work in their own silos.

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.520
 And it's very hard to link data from one to another.

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.720
 For example, if you have a journal application,

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.200
 you can say things like, hey, today I met this person,

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.200
 and then this person gave me this recipe, whatever.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.400
 But you know that the person information is still kept

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.320
 in a different application and the recipe information

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.080
 is still kept in a different application.

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.760
 You have to do a lot of work to kind of make them come together.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.040
 So one thing that happened also last year

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.680
 was that I started using org room a lot.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.080
 So org room is a little casting system

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.040
 which allows you to have linked notes.

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.440
 I'll not go too much into that detail,

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.200
 but basically with org room, you can have

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.440
 a lot of these text-based files that you make anyway,

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.960
 and then keep them connected and have this knowledge base

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.960
 that you can build around your information, your data.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.360
 While it's a good system, I still feel like it's not

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.440
 very pro on providing very good amount of tools

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.920
 for working with links.

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.320
 I'll show two kind of things.

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.400
 First is that I'll show how my current knowledge base

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.760
 looks like, what kind of workflow I kind of use to save

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.560
 let's say any information or how do I connect new notes.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.840
 The other is that because while this information base

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.760
 is working out well for me, I still want all of my external

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:37.080
 usages to be reflected back into this database of text files.

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.240
 So if I'm browsing something, I still want that thing

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.800
 to be saved in my org mode files.

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.440
 With that, I'm browsing on Android or on browsing on Firefox

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.080
 somewhere on a laptop.

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.160
 So I'll show those two things here.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.840
 It's going to be a short talk, and then yeah, hope you like it.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.560
 So we'll start with this thing.

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.000
 So this is a simple org room node.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.080
 It's a dummy node.

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.880
 I've made a lot of dummy nodes here just to kind of show.

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.040
 So maybe some of those information will be sparse,

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.840
 but I hope I convey the meaning clearly.

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.560
 So here, if you usually, if I just using plain org mode,

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.400
 you just have this file, there's nothing else.

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.360
 Now, if you are using org room,

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.000
 you can do something called org room buffer toggle,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.880
 which will show you a few of those connected nodes.

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.880
 Now, usually the connections are shown here.

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.560
 They only show you backlinks.

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.760
 So basically, any other node that has linked to this node

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.720
 is going to be shown there.

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.160
 But in my extension, you can see more things.

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.160
 For example, here in this case, you can see,

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.480
 first of all, we show both links.

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.360
 So any link from this node to something else

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.280
 will also be shown there, any link from that node

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.800
 to something else will also be shown there.

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.400
 So you can see that is one thing.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.960
 The other thing is that all these links are

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:58.600
 categorized in type of nodes.

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.920
 For example, when this node is specifically right now

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.160
 is of kind book, tag is one identifier for it,

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:09.000
 but there are other ways to identify a kind of node.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.800
 But this is connected to another node which is of a kind person.

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:15.840
 So as you can see, the person A asked me to read this book.

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.320
 So that link is shown there in a very rich format.

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:23.440
 So you have more information about the link in this.

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:24.600
 The other thing that you can see there

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:29.360
 is that there are also links which are not existing right now,

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.200
 but they could be possibly interesting for me.

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:34.280
 So these are similar nodes.

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.400
 So you can see the scores of similarity

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.960
 and then other nodes like book on mathematics,

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.680
 which are the another dummy node that I made for this demo.

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.760
 Now, these are nodes which, again, I can just go in there

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.760
 and I can see if maybe they make sense of,

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:51.280
 I can just make those connections explicitly.

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.200
 So let's try some other node here.

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:56.160
 So let's say, so this is a node of a recipe.

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:57.880
 It's a bomb by sandwich.

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.240
 It's a recipe I've made.

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:02.600
 Now, if you go here on the right, you can see,

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:06.560
 there are some things on some person liking the sandwich.

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.520
 There are some related nodes also, similar nodes,

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:10.880
 which I am not linked.

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:12.600
 Plus, there are some general entries.

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:19.280
 Now, I use augroom daily to kind of write down general entries.

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:24.080
 And then what I have to do is basically just write whatever I want

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.600
 and then just make those links to this node.

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:31.320
 So for doing that, I can see that there were two days

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:34.720
 where I made bomb by sandwich and I had some observations

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:38.040
 on it, which you know, I can see here, right, same.

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:40.960
 So same for a person, let's say, if you go to person B,

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.440
 you can see that, you know, this person has again linked to person A

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.680
 and there's like some information around it.

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:48.520
 Plus, there are some similar nodes there.

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.640
 This works really well.

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:52.200
 The similarity function works really well

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:55.360
 if you're basically trying to go to, you know,

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:56.480
 bookmarks that I've saved.

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:58.680
 So, for example, here's bookmark that I saved,

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:01.480
 which is Google at InterSpeed, 2033.

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:05.320
 Now, this bookmark is a blog post from Google AI team.

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:08.160
 Basically, it, you know, tells what research publications

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:10.120
 they had in this conference.

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:11.640
 Now, if you go to the similar nodes here,

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:14.720
 you can see a very similar blog post from Google's team

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:17.000
 for other conferences that they attended, right.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
 Now, this is really helpful for me, especially when I'm like

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.800
 reading something later.

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.000
 So I like to save a lot of links together.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.040
 And then when I'm deciding to read something,

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:27.200
 I just open this and then see, you know,

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:29.240
 however, everything is going to be what I'll say.

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:31.600
 I have saved, should I read something else or not.

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:33.800
 One interesting feature I was realizing,

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.560
 I should try out is that, you know,

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:39.560
 if I go to this node, which is person B,

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:42.720
 you can see that while I'm linking this to person A,

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:44.960
 I also have some context around that.

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:48.240
 So I'm written, I've written specifically uncle of person A.

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:49.560
 Now, if you have a semantic wiki,

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:53.440
 you will have a typed link where you don't have a plain link.

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:55.320
 You also have a type of the link.

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:57.240
 So in this case, the type of the link could be, you know,

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:01.880
 hey, it's like uncle Colin, whatever that link is.

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:05.240
 But, you know, I don't want to like go into that as detail

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:08.200
 and I don't want to like learn how to link things,

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:09.680
 learn what kind of types I can make.

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:11.720
 So I can just write things in plain text.

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:12.840
 So I've written this in plain text.

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:16.640
 What I can do now is I can just search for links like this.

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:19.560
 For example, I can just do something like family members.

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:23.160
 Now, this will show me all the links which have a context

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:26.920
 which makes sense as family members.

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:29.080
 So basically this is a semantic search on links

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:31.240
 on the context of the links and then, you know,

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:33.200
 it kind of gives me what I want here.

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:36.160
 For example, here in this demo, I just had like one node,

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:38.800
 one link which had this uncle relationship.

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:39.960
 So that kind of works out.

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:41.240
 Now, let's just try another search.

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:46.000
 For example, let's say if I'm typing check before meeting.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.800
 So these are now again links where I have written something

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:52.320
 where I kind of should do something before meeting someone.

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:54.960
 So for example, the first one you can see,

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:57.720
 there's a person called meeting person.

00:07:57.720 --> 00:07:59.000
 It's a demo node again.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.560
 And I've written one note about one connection here

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:05.760
 is basically saying that, hey, you know,

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:09.280
 read this link before you go to meet them, right?

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:11.240
 So it's also been very helpful for me.

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:13.360
 There are like a few patterns where I kind of feel

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:14.960
 this works out well.

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:18.840
 As I keep making more of the links

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:20.720
 and keep writing more context around the link,

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:24.000
 this kind of works out really helpful.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.160
 This becomes really helpful for me.

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:28.160
 Okay, so the other few things, you know,

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:32.120
 how do I like work with systems outside EMAX, right?

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:33.640
 So the first thing is that, you know,

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:36.960
 I haven't found anything that works really well

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:41.960
 for saving bookmarks when I'm on my Android phone.

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:44.600
 So I had to make new applications, application,

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:47.000
 and it's called pile Android.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.240
 Now this application basically, you know,

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:50.920
 let's me do whatever I was doing with Raindrop,

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:52.360
 which was a bookmark manager.

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:53.360
 So I can open links.

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:55.440
 I can read stuff in Firefox on my browser,

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:57.280
 on my Android phone.

00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:00.560
 And then I can say all of that in my org room database.

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:03.000
 org room database here means the org room files that I have

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.360
 because again, these are plain text files.

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:06.440
 I can sync them through mobile phone

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:10.240
 to my, you know, desktop and laptop and everything else.

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:11.880
 So that's one place where I kind of, you know,

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:15.160
 stop going to a new application.

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:18.200
 I just basically ingest everything in my org room setup.

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:22.880
 The other thing is that when I'm browsing on my laptop,

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:25.240
 I still want to, you know,

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:28.200
 collect all the data inside my org room system.

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:31.160
 So here's something which I called org room site kick.

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:33.680
 Now what you can do here is that,

00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:36.000
 let's say if you want to search for something,

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.160
 so you can basically do a search normally,

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:40.280
 which is going to do a web search.

00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:43.120
 But if you call org room SK, which is site kick,

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:47.720
 it will do a search on all of your org room notes.

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:50.800
 So now this search is basically using recall.

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:52.960
 So recall kind of indexes all the plain text

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:55.480
 and does a full text search for you.

00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:57.480
 But this is really helpful because when I'm searching

00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:59.760
 for something and I still want to know that,

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:02.960
 hey, I have saved some of those links earlier.

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:05.360
 So can I like, you know, see them back?

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:08.480
 And then, you know, it's a very good way

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:11.200
 to kind of not lose track of what you've already saved.

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:14.720
 The other thing I can do is like I can also,

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:19.720
 you know, again, since I have saved a project in my org room,

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:22.440
 I can basically call again, site kick again

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:25.280
 and I can see a note for that.

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:27.960
 That note here specifically is tracking my tasks

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:29.200
 for this project.

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:30.760
 And other than task, you know, again,

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:32.800
 I can see other things like similar notes.

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:37.000
 I can see, you know, other links that are there.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.600
 So, yeah, so this, there's some optimizations to be done.

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:42.800
 I think this, you know, the bookmark here

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:44.400
 is not very intuitive.

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:47.200
 I still want, I want this to be follow,

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:50.360
 follow in the browser as I switch tabs.

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:53.120
 But again, those things are something I'll work on.

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:55.000
 Other optimizations include, you know,

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.760
 the way I'm doing the search using ML

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:01.080
 that needs a little bit of fine tuning

00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:03.920
 because every time I make a new link,

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:06.800
 I have to like rerun the, you know,

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:09.200
 re kind of build the features and everything else,

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:12.600
 which I make it to be real time.

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:15.400
 Yeah, so that concludes my talk.

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:16.800
 Hope you enjoyed it.

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:18.880
 Let me know if there are any questions.

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:19.720
 Thank you.
