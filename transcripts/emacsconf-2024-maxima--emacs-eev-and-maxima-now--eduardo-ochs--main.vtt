WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.640
 Hi, my name is Eduardo Axe, I'm the author of an obscure

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.400
 reference package called EV, and I think that it's better to start this

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.360
 presentation by the middle of the story, by this world here, Maxima.

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.280
 Maxima is a computer algebraic system that has several interfaces.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:24.080
 One of them is WX Maxima that looks very modern and it's very pretty,

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.400
 and it looks like this. It's a cell-based interface. We can

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.960
 type an expression here and execute it.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.880
 Here's the result. But I don't like that interface because my memory is

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.640
 very bad. I typed very slowly and with lots of mistakes.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.680
 So for me, this ignorant interface that I'm going to show now

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.840
 is much better, and here I'm going to show how I am teaching that

00:00:51.840 --> 00:01:00.000
 ugly interface to beginners. If I type F/8 on these three lines here,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.160
 it creates a Maxima running inside the Max, I mean,

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.160
 using a terminal and running inside the shell buffer in Max,

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:16.000
 and if I type F/8 on these lines here, the F/8 sand lines to Maxima,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:23.200
 and that is a small problem through this. I live in Brazil when people

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.520
 in developed countries cannot imagine how are the

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.160
 beginners that we have here. In the sense that Brazil is another planet,

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.160
 let me explain why, and also let me explain why Maxima,

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.360
 why Max? Because people always say you should use

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.920
 programs that everyone finds intuitive, like VS Code.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.280
 Well, I teach calculus in a bad campus of a good federal university in Brazil.

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.000
 My university is called UF for Universidad Federal FeminÃ©s.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.480
 The main campus of UF is in Italy. It's that's a big city in here,

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.480
 here, here, and here. And I work in a city called Here's Azurstras,

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:07.040
 that is a small city, 200 kilometers away from here, here, and here.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:12.720
 I started working there in 2009. My campus gets

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.800
 very little funding. That's a long story that I don't have

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:22.640
 time to tell now, and we get the students that don't get enough marks in the

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.720
 admission process to get to better places.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:33.200
 Also, my campus has two institutes. I call them the Institute of Humanities

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:40.080
 and the Institute of Inhumanities. Each of our institutes has a small building.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.400
 The Humanities Building has lots of plants and lots of graffiti.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.760
 I call it the Good Building. And the Inhumanities Building has lots of rules

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.280
 and prohibitions. I call it the Evil Building.

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:58.560
 I heard that the Inhumanities Building has a laboratory with computers,

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.320
 and that it doesn't have any machine that runs Linux.

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:07.280
 But the Inhumanities Building is shrouded in mystery,

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.200
 and basically humans avoid it, only in humans go there.

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.880
 We've only discovered how much another planet, Brazil, is a few months ago.

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.480
 In May and June of this year, the Federal Universities in Brazil

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.800
 paralyzed their activities in the nationwide strife of two months.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:29.840
 And during the strike, the Humanities students occupied the Humanities Building

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:35.120
 and organized lots of activities there. They asked me if I could give some

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:41.200
 workshops, and I offered two hands-on workshops on free software for beginners.

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:50.320
 Basically, on MX and EV, with tutorials, with lots of try-its.

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:56.800
 And as usual, the students of computer science and engineering ignored

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:01.200
 the workshop completely and didn't come. But some students of psychology

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:07.360
 and of production cultural, which is basically techniques for producing

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:12.800
 cultural activities, came to my workshop, and they loved the workshop.

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:18.160
 They found it fun. And after the workshop, I told the students that

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.080
 there are lots of things that, between quotes, everyone knows,

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:27.200
 and I don't. And I would like to learn them. But I find them too hard to learn

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.840
 by myself because I'm a dinosaur. I'm only used to interfaces that are very

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:37.120
 old and that they're not graphical. And one of the examples of the things that I

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.840
 would like to learn is cover. And then the student of production

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:49.120
 could route taught me cover in 10 minutes, and that changed my life.

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.440
 So the student of production could route taught me cover in 10 minutes, and that

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:59.440
 changed my life. Anyway, again, I'm working in that place, Hill Desertors,

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:05.280
 since 2009. And the computer science students here know lots of

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.440
 programs and language that I would like to learn. But in all these 15

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:15.040
 years, the computer science students only help with twice.

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:20.640
 It turns out that our inhumanities students don't have a culture of sharing

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:26.080
 and helping. But our humanities students do.

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:31.600
 Another detail about how much Brazil is another planet.

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:37.600
 Well, I only discovered this very recently too. My research is in logic.

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:42.960
 I sometimes go to conferences, usually in Brazil very, very outside.

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:48.240
 And people here don't bring their laptops to the conferences.

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:52.720
 We don't have a culture of sitting together with friends or colleagues to learn

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:57.120
 with them how to use the programs that they use.

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:02.800
 For example, many of my friends,

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:06.640
 are musicians who have to draw lots of diagrams.

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:13.840
 And I don't know how they use their problems to draw diagrams.

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:17.920
 I don't know how things are in universities with good computer labs.

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:24.960
 But anyway, consider these sentences that sort of everybody says.

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:29.120
 Everyone knows VS Code, everyone knows Jupyter notebooks,

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:31.600
 everyone draws diagrams with Quiver.

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:36.480
 Here, these things are not true. They're not relevant.

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:38.960
 Here, knowledge about programs do not propagate.

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:46.560
 And one of my goals in life is to become friends with some people who know how to use,

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:52.000
 for example, code blocks in org and JavaScript, and learn some of their workflows.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.600
 Or rather, one of my goals is to become someone who deserves help.

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:04.480
 More on maximum for students.

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:09.680
 Remember, our inhumanities students don't have a culture of sharing and helping,

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:11.760
 but our inhumanities students do.

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:17.760
 I've interviewed my students, I teach calculus two and three here.

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:22.560
 They will learn, they will learn much faster if they learn Maxima,

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:28.800
 and that people who learn Maxima can take an optional test and an extra max in the course.

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:34.720
 But if they behave as typical inhumanities students,

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:38.880
 I mean not asking questions and not helping their colleagues,

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:40.240
 then I won't help them.

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:44.880
 Actually, it's even worse.

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:49.200
 I've told my students that my documentation is not good enough yet,

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:52.400
 and every question helps me a lot.

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:55.920
 So please ask questions and I've begged on my knees.

00:07:55.920 --> 00:08:04.560
 And now I can treat students who don't ask questions as people who won't help someone that they know

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:06.720
 who is begging on his knees.

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:14.080
 Now let me explain another word of the title of this presentation.

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:18.480
 The title of this presentation is MX-EV and Maxima now.

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:23.600
 The now in the title means in less than one hour,

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:27.360
 and even for people who have never seen a terminal in their lives.

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:33.040
 Well, my title is a slight exaggeration.

00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:38.720
 It only took less than one hour for one person who is a school kid from a small city in the

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:45.120
 north of Brazil, who didn't know anything about programming, but who was competing in the local

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:47.920
 math Olympiad, so not a typical person.

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:56.720
 Now let me tell a story based on real events and based on a real student.

00:08:56.720 --> 00:09:00.000
 The student said, "I have Linux on my laptop.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.680
 Can you help me to do Blah1?"

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:05.440
 I answered, "Sure, do Blah2 and Blah3."

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:11.680
 This was all by chat. I don't remember if by WhatsApp or by Telegram.

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:19.040
 Then one week passes and the student talks to me again and the student says, "It doesn't work."

00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:23.200
 And I answered, "What happens when you do Blah4 and Blah5?"

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:25.120
 Another week passes.

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:29.200
 Then the student reappears and he says, "It doesn't work."

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:35.840
 And I answered, "Type Blah6 and Blah7 in the terminal plus press Enter."

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:37.760
 Take a photo of your screen.

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:40.800
 Remember, not a screenshot, it's photo of your screen.

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:41.760
 And send it to me.

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:48.400
 Then the student disappears again, another week passes and the student reappears and says,

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:50.000
 "How do I open a terminal?"

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.880
 Well, then, Blonk.

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:59.840
 According to the jargon file, Blonk is the sound of that a newbie makes

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:02.560
 as he follows to the bottom of a kill file.

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:05.200
 I prefer the simple definition here.

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:13.040
 From it Blonk is the sound that the person makes when he, she, or they hits the bottom of my list of priorities.

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:19.120
 I've been using this slogan with my students.

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:22.880
 It sounds much better in Portuguese, sorry.

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:29.760
 I am not a telepath and for me it is 100 times harder to discover the doubts of people who don't

00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:33.680
 talk to me than to discover the doubts of people who do talk to me.

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:47.120
 There's an interesting thing here in this presentation by Abilson and Susman.

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:52.880
 Let me explain now this word of my title, MX.

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:57.600
 And the idea is that learning MX can mean many things.

00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:02.000
 Learning Lisp can mean many things and in this presentation,

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.760
 oh no, one second.

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:09.280
 Sorry, back.

00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:11.760
 In this presentation they say,

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:18.400
 anyone can learn Lisp in one day except that if they already know for Trump,

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:20.080
 then it would take three days.

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:25.840
 And I would add, and if the person is starting with Doom MX,

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:28.800
 then it would take five years, why?

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:32.880
 Because the person is using a different notion of MX,

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:39.600
 and if a different notion of Lisp, the person is starting by spending five years learning how to

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:46.320
 configure MX, and the person is using Lisp as a very weird configuration language.

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:51.280
 Usually the people who start by doing MX, they start by configuring MX,

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:55.200
 and only then they learn things like the fun, etc.

00:11:55.840 --> 00:12:01.760
 And another slogan that I use a lot with my students is that there are many cases

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:05.840
 in which learning just the thing B takes 200 hours,

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:10.560
 but the buttering in B, A, and then B takes just 20 hours.

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:17.840
 Here are some kinds of beginners that I do not want to help.

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:23.440
 First example, a person who says, "I can't read that page, it has too many links."

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:30.160
 Second example, a person who says, "I don't want to read anything, and I don't want to learn anything.

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:32.000
 I want something that just works."

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:37.760
 And third example, "I don't want to look at examples.

00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:40.640
 You need to summarize everything to me in one paragraph."

00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:44.880
 There are more explanations on these kinds of beginners,

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:48.720
 and my page about this presentation here.

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:54.480
 And here is one kind of beginner that I really want to help.

00:12:54.480 --> 00:13:03.280
 Beginners that are nerdicates who I use to read the materials that are too advanced for them,

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:06.640
 understanding only a few percent of what they read,

00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:10.080
 remembering just a tiny fraction of what they read,

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:17.840
 going back to these materials later, and taking notes about what they read.

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:26.480
 And who are also always interested in experimenting with new ways of taking notes,

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:29.920
 transcribing summarizing and saving links to primary sources.

00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:39.680
 I'd like to say something about how I've been plonking the paragraph people,

00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:43.440
 who are the people who say, "I don't want to look at examples.

00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:46.240
 You need to summarize everything to me in one paragraph."

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:53.520
 Well, I'm a mathematician. I work with lots of things that can only be summarized in a paragraph.

00:13:53.520 --> 00:14:01.840
 If we choose the level of who we're talking to, so we have many different one paragraph summaries,

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:09.360
 one for each level. And in many cases, this sentence, you need to summarize it in one paragraph.

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:13.440
 It's wrong. The person means, "I want to learn a lot in 10 minutes."

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.680
 And this needs diagrams, animations, and examples.

00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:23.280
 This is an example of something in mathematics and category theory

00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:31.120
 that I only understood after too many times, after Zillions of years. It's called the Yoneda Lemma.

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:35.200
 This is the general case, just a small thing here.

00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:42.960
 But I only understood it after understanding many particular cases,

00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:52.480
 and then organizing them in a way in which different figures have different shapes and whatever.

00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:59.920
 And the text or explanations for the Yoneda Lemma, the one paragraph explanations or the many

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:09.360
 paragraph explanations never helped much. And they contained formulas in mathematics, but written

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:16.160
 linearly that had too many symbols. And my mental buffer is very small. And I had to find several

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:23.600
 tricks to reduce the cognitive overload of all these ideas. For example, I had to name the

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:32.640
 symbols conceptually, like A, B, C. So there's a kind of a temporal order in the symbols in which

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:41.360
 the symbols that appear first have initial letters. I had to find a way to put an unarchitectible case

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:47.680
 in the general case side to side. They have the same shape. I had to find good conventions for

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:58.480
 fonts and types. I had to choose good meanings for what it means for what are vertical arrows,

00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:05.200
 what are horizontal arrows, and so on. What is above without an arrow?

00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:12.160
 So how much detail should we include in our technical explanations?

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:17.360
 Well, there are many measures for cognitive overload or cognitive overload.

00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:23.200
 For example, I asked many technical questions on the maximum mailing list that got answers

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:29.920
 that included snippets and names of list functions, common list, because maximum is written and common

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:37.760
 list. And I liked that. And I asked some technical questions on the org mailing list and on the hyperbole mailing

00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:44.880
 list. And usually I got answers that avoid the technical details, not that I chose the term avoid it

00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:54.400
 to denote frustration. By the way, if one of my students panics on this part here, after

00:16:54.400 --> 00:17:02.080
 setting the user and password, you will get a unique prompt. If the student panics on this and

00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:07.920
 does not know what to ask and just gives up, then plonk.

00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:18.560
 So I was talking a lot about plonking people. And what's left after plonking many people? Well,

00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:23.520
 several kinds of beginners that I want to interact with. Note that kinds is plural.

00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:35.760
 Also, I get a definition for the term beginners. I think in books that, like technical books that

00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:43.520
 start with this book is written for the persons of the type search and search, or maybe several

00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:51.440
 definitions for the term beginners. Also, a metric that lets me choose between options A, B and C

00:17:51.440 --> 00:18:02.800
 when I'm trying to write material for my beginners. For example, here again, should I explain what

00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:15.040
 is a unique prompt? No. Why no? Well, let me use another example. This one I took from a discussion

00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:24.080
 on IRC. We were helping a certain beginner that was there and one person suggested to the beginner

00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:31.600
 to do this type meta colon and then this thing here and then enter. And I suggested this instead.

00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:38.240
 Copy this expression to your notes and then type Ctrl-E, Ctrl-X, Ctrl-E. And the

00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:43.520
 minimonic for Ctrl-E, Ctrl-X, Ctrl-E is Ctrl-XF, because it is executing.

00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:53.120
 Well, for me, the option one, this option here, is very costly because the person has to type a lot

00:18:53.120 --> 00:19:05.680
 without errors and then after running that and reading this page here, the way of going back to that

00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:11.520
 page is gone. So the person has to commit lots of information to memory, either the person learns

00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:19.040
 from this page, everything that she needs, or the person learns and memorizes how to go there

00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:28.000
 the next time. And for me, the option shoe, this one, but this in your notes and then executed with

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:35.040
 Ctrl-XF is much better because the person commits information to notes and the person learns a way

00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:46.880
 to return to this note of the manual later. And with this, the person learns another way to use her notes.

00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:54.400
 I have a lot of material about that. See, for example, this page here, there's a link to it in my

00:19:54.400 --> 00:20:00.880
 page for this talk. Also, I live in a place in which people who fight my instructions to

00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:08.160
 complex or to boring disappear, either for months or forever. So if I put an instruction or if I

00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:13.920
 give an instruction that the person cannot understand and the person gives up, I lose the person.

00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:21.680
 Now, let me do some things in a weird order. In a normal presentation, this would be the conclusion,

00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:27.600
 and it would be presented at the end, but I will present it now before the technical details.

00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:36.800
 So I was teaching a Max-AV and Maxima for students. Did it work? Well, sort of, but in a weird way.

00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:44.960
 Many students decided to take my test on a Max-AV and Maxima. Let me consider only the 35

00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:51.440
 students in the true last semester that were able to do what I asked. That was to use a link like

00:20:51.440 --> 00:21:00.800
 this one and to go to my notes. They had to go to a specific small program in Maxima,

00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:06.640
 copy that program to their notes, modify it a bit to make it solve a slightly different program,

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:13.200
 problem, and then save the new program. So it was most a test on the interface and to test if

00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:20.240
 they knew some very basic things on Maxima. But of these 35 students, only 10 students

00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:27.600
 asked questions on the telegram group. Mostly they discussed with other students, sometimes live.

00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:38.880
 They would bring their laptops to the university to discuss. They only do that very rarely, but they

00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:45.440
 brought it sometimes. Other times they would discuss with their colleagues on the squad,

00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:48.400
 but I got very little feedback from our usability test.

00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:56.720
 So my experiment failed in the sense that I didn't get the feedback that I expected. I only got

00:21:56.720 --> 00:22:04.160
 a fraction of the feedback that I expected, but along lots of things. Well, I got very angry,

00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:10.880
 very frustrated, but I saw that I can't invest a lot of energy on students who, how they say,

00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:20.000
 once talked to me. Then they decided to make contact with some schools, secondary schools,

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:26.320
 and to make a long story short. In one of the schools, I was very well received.

00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:32.480
 The students asked lots of questions and in the middle of the discussion, we were discussion.

00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:39.680
 This little program here that splits the frame in show windows, and displays the file help

00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:50.080
 in the window at the right. And I showed them my list tutorial that starts with this in here.

00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:55.600
 And in writing it's section, it explains code.

00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:06.400
 So I had to explain them how we can use code to pass to avoid evaluating a program.

00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:13.520
 And we can use code to pass on evaluated programs as arguments and quote, "blue their minds".

00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:19.840
 And I was amazed by the questions and I saw more clearly that the compass in which I work as a whole,

00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:25.440
 and I need to do more things outside. Now let's see some technical details.

00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:34.160
 What exactly am I teaching to these students? Basically, my old tutorial for EV was this one.

00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:39.040
 It started with a section on installing EV and then it explains

00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:48.640
 least how to use a list of hyperlinks and then lots of other things. But I'm using this new

00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:54.160
 tutorial here that I am not announcing in many places because I wanted to test it a lot before

00:23:55.600 --> 00:24:08.160
 making it very public. And it starts with other installation instructions that start with instructions

00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:16.720
 for installing WSL on a machine with windows and then installing Debian there. And then after that

00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:29.920
 people have to install a max and then they have to install a EV. And I'm also using this map

00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:39.520
 here that I'm reorganizing. So it's going to change a lot in the next days. It has true dimensional

00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:48.080
 map here and it has lots of things that I'm putting in a single place to make it easier to answer

00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:54.080
 questions and to show to the students that I have answered most common questions, most of the common

00:24:54.080 --> 00:25:03.200
 questions. Remember, my target audience is mostly composed of beginners who have never seen a terminal

00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:08.480
 in their lives and that get bored very quickly. And when they get bored, they disappear.

00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:20.160
 What are my main goals for the first day? I want to install everything where everything means

00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:29.680
 WSL on their windows machines. Then Debian, MX, EV, lots of Debian packages that they install

00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:50.320
 with this blog here. After that they need to run some example programs and some test blogs

00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:58.480
 and configure MX and create a first set of executable notes. And consider that after that the

00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:05.920
 person is autonomous. I said that the students learn how to run some maxima programs. That may be

00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:14.960
 more precise about that. The first step is something that I call the first five minute workshop

00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:24.160
 and it happens in the classroom on my laptop. And I make the students run these. Actually in the first

00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:33.200
 moment I run this thing here and then I ask them to run it themselves. So I type F8 on these

00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:39.600
 three things here. We get a target buffer running maxima. Then I type F8 several other times here.

00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:47.280
 When I type F8 here it opens a no plot window that I have to close by typing Q here again.

00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:55.600
 And that's it. And then I say now it's your turn. And the students go there. They type F8 three times

00:26:55.600 --> 00:27:01.200
 and then they type F8, F8, F8, F8, F8, F8, Q, F8, Q.

00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:10.160
 The second step is similar. It's another individual workshop also just a few minutes long

00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:17.440
 in which they happen. They learn how to access my notes. My notes on maxima are here. I mean this is

00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:26.800
 the HTMLized version. It starts with the header. Then a huge index here. Then many blocks like this.

00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:35.680
 And this is a specific block that corresponds to the thing that we run in the first five minute

00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:44.240
 workshop. And in this second five minute workshop they run the instructions in this section here.

00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:49.040
 Usually I skip this thing in the first moment. Then I explain it to them.

00:27:49.040 --> 00:28:02.640
 And they run something like this that downloads a copy of my notes on maxima parts that

00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:08.800
 copy in the temporary buffer and they can run the thing here exactly in the same way as before.

00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:25.120
 And they can also, sorry, I also asked them to run my small maximum programs in other blocks.

00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:33.440
 Like this one, for example, if we run this, it calculates the solution of a question that I put

00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:42.640
 in a test one or two semesters ago. It starts by calculating several integrals and then it organizes

00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:53.840
 all the solutions in a big matrix like this. I said that at one point the students have to install

00:28:53.840 --> 00:29:05.040
 lots of Debian packages. This happens after they have installed WSL, W, Debian, then MIX and EV.

00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:11.760
 And they already know a bit about the pitch. So they are in this section of the instructions.

00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:17.920
 And they just have to type a fade here several times and watch what happens.

00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:28.160
 After that we have many options and I have this map here and I usually choose a path according

00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:35.200
 to the interests and the questions of the student. And there are many things that can go wrong.

00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:41.360
 So this page also works as a place in which I put all my troubleshooting instructions.

00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:49.760
 And if a student have a question, I can, I mean, suppose that the student is talking to me by

00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:55.600
 what's up or the student is saying, okay, I installed the things such and such and I tried to think

00:29:55.600 --> 00:30:02.000
 blah blah and something went wrong. And they say, okay, can you send me a screenshot or a photo

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:08.000
 of your screen? And then we can troubleshoot that by using a section of this page here.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:14.880
 This is a way of working progress and reorganizing this thing for the 10th time.

00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:22.880
 The rest of what can happen with these students can't be explained clearly in a video.

00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:29.280
 So I'm going to put all the other stuff in the page of the video and I'm going to stop the video here.

00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:33.520
 So thanks and bye!
