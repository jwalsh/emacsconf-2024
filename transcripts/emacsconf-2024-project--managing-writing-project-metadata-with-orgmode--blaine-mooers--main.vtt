WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.260
 Good morning. I'm Glenn Moore's, I'm an Associate Professor of Biochemistry and Physiology

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:17.880
 at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences in Oklahoma City. I'll be talking about the

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:26.700
 utilization of ORD mode to write a specific kind of log file for thinking about writing

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:33.580
 projects and particular research articles. I have stored a template for this file on

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:39.740
 GitHub. You can find it at Moore's Lab if you go to the landing page and scroll down

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:47.280
 to EMAX/LATED. You'll find a link to it.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:53.220
 I am a Structural Biologist and utilize extraterrestrial started feed and terminus structures of proteins

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:59.860
 and nucleic acids that are important in human health. Our workflow is shown across

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:06.520
 the top. We start out with purified material that we crystallized as shown by that elongated

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:13.980
 rod shaped crystal on the left. We will mount that in a cold stream and collect diffraction

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:21.140
 data with x-rays in the instrument to the right. That instrument will generate an image

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:26.180
 like the one to the right. We see a bunch of spots. That's a diffraction pattern from

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:31.220
 the crystal. After rotating the crystal for one degree, we'll rotate the crystal 180

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:37.820
 degrees, get a full data set that will process with a computer. This will lead to the check

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:47.380
 and wire map of the electron density shown further to the right. Then, on a far right,

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:55.940
 we have a compared electro structures of two drug molecules from two different structures

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:02.900
 overlap after a superimposing wild-type protein and mutant protein. We're trying to analyze

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:09.380
 how the mutant was preventing one of the drugs from binding. These analyses can develop

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:20.600
 better drugs. In this case, the drugs are being used to treat lung cancer. When I start

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:29.220
 a new writing project, I will sign it a number. In this case, I'm developing a review article

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:34.180
 about the detection of crystals in images collected with microscopes like the image in the upper

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:46.260
 left. In articles about the utilization of AI to help with that detection of crystals. I

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:55.060
 start the name of the folder with this index number. I store the manuscript folders in the

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:01.940
 top level of my home directory, the E's navigation. Whenever I pop open a terminal window, I just

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:08.580
 enter 0573. It tabbed on a complete name of the folder, and I'll be writing the appropriate folder.

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:15.620
 I also use that index number to label the names of the files. I start every project with three files,

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:21.780
 a manuscript, the log file that I'll be talking about today, and a annotated bibliography, which

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:28.260
 is kind of like one on steroids. The annotated bibliography for the 21st century, not the 20th

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:38.820
 century annotated bibliography, worked on as an undergraduate. I have developed templates, not only

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:46.340
 for own mode, but also for other markup languages like R markdown and Latteck actually developed this

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:56.580
 log file template over a dozen years ago in Latteck. I also have developed it for types,

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:04.180
 as independent of Latteck. It's inspired by Latteck, but it's built, written and rust, and it's

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:13.220
 extremely fast. So my writing process involves having the writing log at the center of the process,

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:20.180
 is where I begin the writing project. On the right I have the manuscript, all its components

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:28.180
 highlighted in yellow, and on the rough, on the, hopefully I said on the right, I have the manuscript

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:34.500
 with all its components highlighted in yellow. On the left I have the annotated bibliography.

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:47.220
 So when I start a research paper, I will do this after I have built up a strong idea from various

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:56.340
 sources, and then I'll sit down and go through a series of steps outlined in the writing log to

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:03.780
 develop that central hypothesis into a several paragraphs that are used in the introduction of

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:10.580
 the manuscript. The rest of the manuscripts built around that central hypothesis, so the results

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:18.020
 section will include experiments that address the central hypothesis, and it will exclude experiments

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:23.140
 and nothing to do with it. Likewise, the discussion points address the central hypothesis.

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:32.180
 So when I've done developing that introduction in, say, three or four hours, I'll have a outline in

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:39.460
 hand, at least for the results and the discussion section, the outline will be detailed down to, at

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:48.340
 least, the sub-heading level, and I'll move those components over to the manuscript on the right.

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:55.300
 And as work is done to address that central hypothesis, the manuscript will be updated,

00:05:55.300 --> 00:06:03.140
 and also as an exploration of literature continues, new ideas will flow in to the manuscript

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:06.100
 through the log file.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:15.540
 You've probably heard of another kind of writing log, which is more of a accountability tool.

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:21.220
 A tool you use to hold yourself accountable in terms of your commitment to work on your writing

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:31.860
 with projects. So this idea of a fault of carrying out this documentation is supported by

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:39.540
 research done by Robert Boyce, Ethan of those academics who record their writing are four times

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:44.820
 more productive of those that do not, and those that actually shared their writing with colleagues

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:51.380
 are nine times more productive. This is sort of a case in point. This is a snapshot of a Google

00:06:51.380 --> 00:07:03.940
 sheet of such a writing log that I was sharing as part of a Google workbook, sharing it with

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:13.380
 that three other colleagues. So I had the possibility of them taking a peek at my Google sheet and

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:22.020
 that possibility I thought would be highly motivating. As you can see, July 24, 2023, I worked on five

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:26.420
 different writing projects. This would not have been possible if it had not been for the

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:32.020
 having five separate writing logs where I could figure out where I had started and where I would

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:38.660
 report the day's progress before maybe taking a break and then switching to another writing project.

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:46.020
 So that writing log helps reduce switching costs between projects.

00:07:46.020 --> 00:08:02.100
 My motivation for developing this project specific log that I'm presenting here is to support

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:08.580
 clear thinking about the science I'm trying to do, hopefully leading to better science, as well as

00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:14.180
 accelerating the completion of the writing project. The secondary purpose is to enable working on

00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:21.060
 multiple writing projects in parallel. This is important to be able to harness your subconscious.

00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:26.900
 So if you work on project A for a few hours in the morning, say early morning, then late morning,

00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:35.620
 you work on project B, while you're working on project B, your subconscious is busy working

00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:42.260
 the way on project A. So as a result, perhaps the following morning,

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:50.180
 while when you wake up or while you're taking a shower or commuting, your new ideas will emerge

00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:55.940
 for projects A and B, as a result of these background jobs that you have launched. If you don't work on

00:08:55.940 --> 00:09:00.340
 project A, then you're not going to get the benefit of the following morning.

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:07.780
 The side effects of using this writing log are that it reduces the fear of forgetting and also

00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:15.460
 reduces the fear of losing momentum. These are two barriers to attempt to carry out work on

00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:20.820
 multiple writing projects in a given day. This problem of dealing with multiple writing projects

00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:26.820
 is one that is not discussed in books about writing. It's apparently a very difficult problem.

00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:31.940
 I think by writing log is a successful solution to that problem.

00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:41.700
 This is a overview of the writing log in or mode. So it has various components. I don't have

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:48.660
 time to go through all of them in detail. But you can see its structure. We get this

00:09:48.660 --> 00:10:00.020
 summary view and you open up the file. If you have this in the header for a startup command overview

00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:08.740
 and then I just click on the heading, hit tab to see the contents below. So normally I'm just going

00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:18.020
 to go straight to the daily log, which is in this case it starts on line 944. I don't have to scroll

00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:23.940
 away down to it because of thanks to the support for folding these sections in or mode.

00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:32.100
 If I open up the drawer label preamble, I see that you can see that I have imported a number of

00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:41.060
 a lot of packages to enhance the format of the PDF file that is upon XB.

00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:49.780
 I have commands that are listed below at the bottom for providing a fancy header. This header has

00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:56.500
 the current date as well as the running title and the current page number and total number of pages.

00:10:56.500 --> 00:11:05.940
 So you can see in the center the header at the start page 2. We see the bottom page 1 where the

00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:15.860
 page number is at the bottom of the page. So this, these headers are very useful if you

00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:23.620
 have them to print out several log files and their corresponding manuscripts and take them with you

00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:29.780
 to work on them while traveling and variably the pages will get intermingled and we'll have to sort

00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:38.820
 about when you return home. So these headers ease that problem. You can see that the table contents

00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:46.500
 that begin the writing log is hyperlinked to various sections. In addition to the table contents,

00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:52.820
 the log file course will support various graphical objects like images, tables, equations,

00:11:52.820 --> 00:12:00.420
 code listings. I also added to the tech support for index, lists of acronyms, glossary, math

00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:08.980
 implementation, or literature cited. It takes no effort to add these in so why not have them available.

00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:15.380
 These features are also available in the annotated bibliography template which helps support

00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:26.420
 make that annotated bibliography far more relevant and interesting. So this shows a list of

00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:32.820
 four workflows that I'm going to discuss. Since I don't have time to go for each of the

00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:38.900
 items, so obviously there's project initiation occurs on day one. If I have a three or four hour

00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:47.540
 block at time, that's sufficient to finish project initiation. And then the daily workflow is

00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:54.500
 obviously what a person today to move the project forward and the periodic assessments are done

00:12:54.500 --> 00:13:00.500
 on a monthly weekly basis, generally on a weekly basis as the submission deadline approaches.

00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:08.420
 And then after you have received the gallery proofs and sent them back there are a few chores that

00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:14.180
 need to be done in terms of project close-up. And so this is an example of a protocol that could be

00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:21.060
 followed to do that. And an example of the kinds of more or less appendix material that could be

00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:30.500
 included in the writing log to help that this is done. So this shows a project initiation section

00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:41.540
 of the workflow. So I go through a series of sections that include advice about what I need to do

00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:51.140
 to complete each section. So the rationale section asked me like why are you doing this? Why should you

00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:59.380
 do this? Why not somebody else? Those sort of fundamental questions. And then I have

00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:08.500
 a drawer called label guidance that I have and that headline me or above, I have this no export

00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:16.740
 to keyword. So that guidance is not written out upon export to the PDF. Unless you want it,

00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:22.660
 if you want it, you have to remove the no export tag. Then I have a response to these questions.

00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:29.140
 In this case, the list of journals that I'm targeting for submission of this review article.

00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:38.260
 I have a plan B journal picked out in case the first choice is leads to the editors decide to

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:50.500
 reject it. So having a plan D journal picked out is a decision can make at the time of submission

00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:56.740
 so that you're prepared to move quickly after the article is rejected.

00:14:56.740 --> 00:15:07.220
 This shows the daily workflow section. So each entry has a date. I sometimes annotate the

00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:14.180
 dated entries with a small phrase to highlight certain events. Within a given entry,

00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:19.540
 I have a list of accomplishments. That's sort of the bare minimum what I include. This just

00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:26.260
 demonstrates how relatively brief these entries are. They're just whatever distinct

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:37.140
 accomplishments for me are listed. Sometimes I'll include the goals for that day. Sometimes I'll

00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:42.740
 always include the correspondence related to the project. So I'll copy and paste an email

00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:54.260
 into a quote environment from La Tech. And I have a snippet template for our generating these

00:15:54.260 --> 00:16:03.140
 entries. It will insert the date, for example, in the subheading. Then below that, I'll have the

00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:08.260
 next action. So following David Allen's, getting things done approach where you identify the next

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:14.100
 thing that is begun. That may have come from a to-do list that's indicated below that.

00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:22.580
 And then beyond that, there's sections for writing accountability and then a reminder to go

00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:30.660
 about updating your central casting and org role that you have come across any nuggets for

00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:37.700
 knowledge you want to add to your org role. Then below that, there's a new another section for the

00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:44.900
 storage of additions to be made to the manuscript. Maybe they're not ready to go yet. So this provides

00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:52.500
 a spot for them to be incubated, a sandbox, if you will, where you have room to develop them further

00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:58.820
 before you, they're ready to be transferred over to the main manuscript. I also have a section

00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:08.420
 there too for the incubation of new ideas for new projects. So these, this kind of meta-data

00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:14.580
 or meta-cognition about the project are often stored and commented out regions are in comments

00:17:14.580 --> 00:17:21.140
 and like MS Word documents. These are often stripped out and rushed to submit the manuscript and

00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:28.260
 are quite often lost yet they can be invaluable. Not only for the preparation of future manuscripts,

00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:35.620
 but there can be very invaluable for responding to pre-teaks by reviewers.

00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:46.660
 So this writing log provides ample room for the safe storage of such information, such knowledge.

00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:57.060
 Then periodically every several months are weeks carry out a assessment of the project.

00:17:57.060 --> 00:18:04.980
 And so we go through a checklist for the completion of the manuscript. We also have a timeline

00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:14.260
 with milestones identified. And then course org has these wonderful tables that are very dynamic.

00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:22.740
 If you need a wider column to accommodate a new entry, it self-adjusts. So these are self-adjusting

00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:30.260
 tables on one reason why I was attracted to org mode because that coming from left tech,

00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:34.180
 we're working with trying to make changes to tables is quite difficult.

00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:41.140
 Then below that is a section to make assessments or four questions that I address about to the status

00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:46.660
 of the project. So one really good question is why can't you submit this project today? What's

00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:56.820
 going to do that back? And so other such existential questions are important to ask from time to time.

00:18:56.820 --> 00:19:07.380
 And finally the project clues out workflow. So this is in the form of a checklist. This checklist

00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:14.740
 in the main template is already included, but you could include it as from an external file.

00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:22.340
 Of course that checklist won't be only in the PDF when it's included in this fashion. It won't

00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:30.500
 be in the org file, but you can view that checklist by clicking on its file path. It serves a link

00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:40.500
 that will open up in a org buffer. The advantage of taking a modular approach to this sort of

00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:46.100
 appendix material is that you can update your protocols and updated protocols will be available

00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:56.260
 to all log files across all projects. So in conclusion this project specific log file helps

00:19:56.260 --> 00:20:05.380
 narrow the focus on one project. It provides space to harbor thinking about that project and it

00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:16.660
 helps support project initiation and sustain this momentum and facilitate its completion.

00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:27.860
 The side effects of using this log file for one project is that it dampens the fear of forgetting

00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:34.180
 the fear of losing momentum, which inhibits working on more than one project in a given day.

00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:45.380
 I would like to thank my friends at an Oklahoma data science workshop. We hold this workshop

00:20:45.380 --> 00:20:53.940
 every third Friday at noon, central time, by Zoom. It's open to participation by people from all

00:20:53.940 --> 00:21:00.020
 around the world. Send an email if you are interested in the applications of computing to

00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:09.380
