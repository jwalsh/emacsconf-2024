00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.540
 Welcome to EmacsCons 2024, where we have fun exploring how much we can do with a text

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:06.540
 editor.

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.240
 It's hard to give a general overview of all the cool talks today and tomorrow, so you

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.720
 can flip through the talks and see what sparks your interests.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.320
 Don't feel limited to one track or another.

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.560
 The best parts of EmacsCons are the conversations.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.760
 The Wiki has a page on how to watch and participate, and I'll give you a quick overview as well.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.600
 You can watch both streams at live.emacsCons.org using free and open source software.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:34.800
 Having a streaming media player like MPV seems to be the best way to watch in terms of performance,

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.080
 but there are also web-based players just in case that's all you've got.

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.880
 The schedule shows the general track on top and the development track on the bottom, so you

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.960
 can see what else is going on.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.760
 As you're watching the talks, you can refer to the schedule in another window, hover

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.440
 over the boxes to see the times and titles, and click on the boxes in the schedule to jump

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.000
 to the talks page for more details.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.320
 You can also get the schedule as an eye calendar file or as an org file in different time zones.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.680
 Many talks will be followed by live Q&A web conferences with a speaker, which will be done

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.840
 in big blue button or BBB.

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.640
 These are indicated with a solid border on the schedule and by Q&A BBB on the schedule

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:12.640
 page.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.280
 You can join the web conference room by clicking on the BBB link on the schedule page or

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.920
 the talks web page.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.280
 Then you can ask your questions yourself when the Q&A starts.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.400
 To improve performance, please keep your webcam off and stay muted until it's your turn

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.400
 to talk.

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.440
 If you don't like JavaScript, you can still ask questions via IRC, and the hosts can read

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:32.440
 them out for you.

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:37.240
 We're probably going to automatically switch between talks and Q&A sessions, so the transitions

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.280
 on the stream might be a little sudden.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.280
 People in the big blue button room can continue the conversation even after the talk moves

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.640
 off stream, and you can also reach out to the speakers using the contact information

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.280
 on the talk page.

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.360
 Other talks will have Q&A via either pad or IRC depending on what the speakers prefer.

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.560
 This is indicated in the schedule with a dashed border and on the schedule page as well.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.960
 As an experiment, the Q&A for them a Clim talk this afternoon will also be in Lamb Demo.

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.360
 If you'd like to try it out, see them a Clim talk page for instructions so you can join

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.880
 the discussion there.

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.560
 The schedule pages and track pages have quick shortcuts so that you can find out more

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.840
 about talks, open the either pads, and join the Q&A sessions.

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.320
 The watch page has more tips on how to make the most of Q&A.

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:24.560
 If you can, please add notes and ask questions in the either pad for the talk, that makes it

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.660
 easier for everyone to share their notes, and speakers and hosts can read the questions

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:29.660
 from there.

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.360
 We'll copy the notes to the talk pages afterwards.

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.420
 We have one pad for each talk, so you can follow the links to get to the next one or go

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.280
 back to the schedule and get the link from there.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:46.400
 If you have general feedback about the conference itself, please put it in pad.emaxclons.org/20204, which

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.400
 is linked in each pad.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.320
 You can also use this as a general community message board for things like help wanted.

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:57.640
 Internet really chat or IRC can be another great way to be part of lots of conversations.

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:02.960
 You can use chat.emaxclons.org to join the IRC channels through your web browser.

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:06.440
 The tabs in the left can help you switch between the different channels.

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:12.280
 There's emaxclons.gen for the general track and emaxclons.dev for the development track.

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:21.840
 If you need to reach us, you can join emaxclons.org or email emaxclons.org/private@gnau.org.

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.360
 You can use emaxclons for hallway conversations.

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:30.160
 Of course you can join any of these channels with your favorite IRC client by connecting to

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:36.280
 irc.libera.chat/port6697 using TLS.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.480
 Once again we're going to be streaming with open captions for most of the talks this year.

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.400
 Thanks for speakers and captioning volunteers.

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.840
 The caption talks are indicated on the schedule and with any luck we'll be posting transcripts

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.880
 and talk pages shortly after the talk start.

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:55.160
 If you need additional accommodations, please let us know in emaxclons.org and we'll see

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.200
 if it can make things happen.

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.040
 If something goes down, we'll update status.emaxclons.org.

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.720
 If it doesn't look like we've noticed yet, please let us know in the emaxclons.org IRC

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:08.960
 channel where we will be quietly panicking.

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:12.600
 In all of these conversations, please keep in mind our guidelines for conduct.

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:16.480
 You can find them on the wiki, they basically boil down to, please be nice.

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:19.800
 If all goes well, the prerequisite of the talks and transcripts should be available from

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:22.560
 the talk pages shortly after they start playing.

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:27.240
 And we'll post the recordings of live talks and Q&A sessions within the next month or so.

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:31.680
 If you'd like to get an update, you can subscribe to the emaxclons.gov/discussmailinglist.

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.640
 Alright, let's get going.

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:37.400
 Leo is hosting the channel track and Karwin is hosting the development track.

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.760
 The other volunteers tonight will run around mostly backstage and you'll probably meet us

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:42.080
 in the closing remarks.

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:46.880
 That's also where we get to thank all the people and organizations who make emaxclons possible.

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.160
 Thanks for coming to emaxclons 2024.
