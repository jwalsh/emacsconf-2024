00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.460
 Welcome to the second day of EMAXCon 2024.

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:07.980
 Today we have one track of talks so you don't have to worry about missing out on anything.

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.960
 The best parts of EMAXCon are the conversations, the wiki as a page and how to watch and participate,

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:15.860
 and I'll give you a quick overview as well.

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:20.900
 You can watch the stream at live.emaxconv.org using free and open source software.

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:26.220
 Using a streaming media player like MPV seems to be the best way to watch in terms of performance,

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.300
 but there are also web-based players just in case that's all you've got.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.940
 As you're watching the talks, you can refer to the schedule in another window.

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.740
 However, over the boxes to see the times and titles,

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:39.900
 and click on the boxes in the schedule to jump to the talks page for more details.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:44.220
 You can also get the schedules in iCounder file or in Org file in different time zones.

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.900
 Many talks will be followed by live Q&A web conferences with a speaker,

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.580
 which will be done in big blue button or BBB.

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:55.940
 These are indicated with a solid border in the schedule and by Q&A BBB on the schedule page.

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:01.700
 You can draw in the webcon friends room by clicking on the BBB link on the schedule page or the talks web page.

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.940
 Then you can ask your questions yourself when the Q&A starts.

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.780
 To improve performance, please keep your webcam off and stay muted until it's your turn to talk.

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.060
 If you don't like JavaScript, you can still ask questions via IRC and the hosts can read them out for you.

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.980
 We're probably going to automatically switch between talks and Q&A sessions,

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:22.140
 so the transitions on the stream might be a little sudden.

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.540
 People in the big blue button room can continue the conversation even after the talk moves off stream.

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.300
 And you can also reach out to the speakers using the contact information on the talk page.

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:37.140
 Other talks will have Q&A via etherpad or IRC depending on what the speakers prefer.

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.540
 This is indicated in the schedule with a dashboarder and on the schedule page as well.

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.540
 Please ask your questions in the recommended places so that the speakers can easily see them.

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.540
 Again, if you ask your questions in IRC, we'll try to copy them to the right places.

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:56.340
 We're going to start Sunday morning with more IRC or etherpad Q&A to try to get around some of the bandwidth issues that we noticed last year.

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.940
 The schedule pages and track pages have quick shortcuts so that you can find out more about talks,

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:04.140
 open the etherpads, and join the Q&A sessions.

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.540
 The watch page has more tips on how to make the most of Q&A.

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.340
 If you can, please add notes and ask questions in the etherpad for the talk.

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.540
 That makes it easier for everyone to share their notes and speakers and hosts can read the questions from there.

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.140
 We'll copy the notes to the talk pages afterwards.

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.940
 We have one pad for each talk so you can follow the links to get to the next one,

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.340
 or go back to the schedule and get the link from there.

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.340
 If you have general feedback about the conference itself,

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:34.340
 please put it in pad.emaxclanf.org/20204, which is linked in each pad.

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.940
 You can also use this as a general community message board for things like help wanted.

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.540
 Or you can put it in IRC and we'll find it there too.

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:46.340
 Internet really chat or IRC can be another great way to be parts of lots of conversations.

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:51.340
 You can use chat.emaxclanf.org to join the IRC channels through your web browser.

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.740
 The tabs on the left can help you switch between the different channels.

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.540
 Most discussions will be in emaxclanf.gen for the general track.

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:07.140
 If you need to reach us, you can join emaxclanf.org or email us at emaxclanf.org/private@gnu.org.

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.340
 You can use emaxclan for hallway conversations.

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.740
 Of course, you can join any of these channels with your favorite IRC client.

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:20.540
 You can connect to IRC.libera.chat.port6697 with TLS.

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.740
 Once again, we're going to be streaming with open captions for most of the talks this year

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:27.340
 thanks to our speakers and captioning volunteers.

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.940
 The caption talks are indicated on schedule and with any luck

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.940
 we'll be posting transcripts and talk pages shortly after the talks start.

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.940
 If you need additional accommodations, please let us know in emaxclanf.org

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:40.940
 and we'll see if we can make things happen.

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.640
 If something goes down, we'll update status.emaxclanf.org

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.840
 If it doesn't look like we've noticed yet, please let us know in the emaxclanf.org IRC channel

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.340
 where we will be quietly panicking.

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:56.340
 In all of these conversations, please keep in mind our guidelines for conduct.

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:57.740
 You can find them on the wiki.

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:00.340
 They basically boil down to, please be nice.

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.540
 If all goes well, the prerecorded talks and transcripts should be available

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:06.140
 from the talk pages shortly after they start playing

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:10.940
 and will post recordings of life talks and Q&A sessions within the next month or so.

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:12.440
 If you'd like to get an update,

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.640
 you can subscribe to the emaxclanf discuss mailing list.

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:17.140
 Alright, let's get going.

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:19.740
 Leo Vivier is hosting the general track again today.

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:23.140
 The other volunteers and I will run around mostly backstage

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:25.640
 and you'll probably meet us in the closing remarks.

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.240
 That's us, oops.

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.440
 That's also where we get to thank all the people and organizations

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.440
 who make emaxclanf possible.

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.140
 Thanks for, oops.

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:36.740
 Thanks for coming to emaxclanf 2024.
