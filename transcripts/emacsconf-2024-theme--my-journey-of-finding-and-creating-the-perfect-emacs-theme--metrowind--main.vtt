00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.320
 Hi, my name is Mattro Wind, in this talk I will take you through my journey into Emax

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:12.320
 themes.

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:19.160
 I am a long-time Emax user, I started using Emax since version 21.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:25.020
 The goal of this talk is to inspire more people into making themes, maybe you are already

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:33.580
 making themes, in that case I hope you could find some tips and tricks in this one.

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:39.740
 I will basically go through all the themes that I created, but I think the most important

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:47.380
 thing here is to understand why some of the colors are picked and the motivations behind

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.020
 them.

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:55.900
 So the first theme I created is called DivinT, it looks like this.

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:01.280
 The inspiration for this one is a website called DivinTart, basically I just used their

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.980
 color palette from their design.

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:14.500
 It was a community for indie artists, I was really into that back in the day, so that's

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:15.500
 that.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.340
 Otherwise nothing special.

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:33.660
 The next theme I created was called FlockUI, it's Imelpa, and let me just show you, FlockUI.

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:42.460
 So, yeah, that's how it looks like.

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:51.580
 So, but where did the colors come from, so I understand that I will need to take you back

00:01:51.580 --> 00:02:01.180
 in time, to where iOS 7 was released by Apple, that was a big deal, because that popularized

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:10.220
 the idea of FlockUI color designs, sorry, FlockUI designs, and after that everybody follows

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:20.540
 you to change their design of their websites and applications to use some sort of flat UI

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.740
 design concepts.

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:30.280
 And about the same time there came a website called flatUIcolors.com, it hosted one color

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.220
 palette, and that was really good.

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:44.460
 So I picked that as the basis of my theme, and initially I named it flatUI, but that name

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:52.780
 was taken in Imelpa, so I just renamed it to something random, FlockUI.

00:02:52.780 --> 00:03:06.380
 This one is called flat, to understand why I need to create this theme, it's because I thought

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:20.140
 some of the colors in FlockUI was standing out too much, like the green here, so this one.

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:25.620
 I thought this is too bright, just a little bit.

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:34.740
 So I thought I needed way to pick some colors that are about the same lightness, essentially.

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:36.540
 So how do I do that?

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:42.060
 The answer is to go into a color space called lab.

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:49.740
 Now normally you do color working RGB, right, which is red, green, and blue.

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:52.940
 It doesn't tell you a lot about lightness.

00:03:52.940 --> 00:04:00.860
 If you do a pure blue, it actually look a lot darker than a pure red or a pure green,

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:03.700
 so that doesn't work.

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:10.540
 But in lab things are different, because one of the channels is L, which is lightness.

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:16.260
 The other two channels are ANB, which are just for the colors.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:21.820
 This is great, because I could just fix L, meaning I fixed the lightness, and then I can

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:25.260
 vary ANB however I want.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:32.700
 The color will stay roughly in the same lightness, which is exactly what I wanted.

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:40.340
 So for that, I created a Mac app, where I could just fix lightness, like I said, and then

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:47.180
 I could click on this colorful thing to pick a color, the app will pick another 5 according

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:48.180
 to some pattern.

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:53.660
 And then I could just, like, hard code these colors in EMAX.

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:58.740
 Let me show you why I think lab.

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:06.380
 Yeah, not very different from flock UI colors, which is intentional.

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:12.820
 But the idea here, again, is all the colors will be in about the same lightness, which I

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:19.660
 guess it was, so yeah, so this one was a success.

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:25.220
 I used it for a really long time, and then I got bored.

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:27.580
 So I needed something interesting.

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:35.740
 The idea at the time was then to create a theme that doesn't have any colors, essentially,

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:41.120
 the gray scale theme.

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:46.140
 So I called it nothing, it is also EMAX.

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:47.980
 It looks like this.

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:51.860
 Yeah, like I said, everything is gray.

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:56.340
 There's no color, but to my surprise, this is actually very usable.

00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:02.020
 I didn't have any problem in readability, I didn't have any problem in distinguish, you

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:04.980
 know, different elements in the code.

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:10.820
 So a big surprise and also a big success, actually.

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:18.860
 And then I got bored, then I just decided to install a whole bunch of themes from NOPA, and

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:23.300
 every time I start EMAX, I just pick a random theme.

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:28.780
 There are some caveats to that, which I don't want to get into.

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:32.220
 But let me just show you why a random theme.

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:39.640
 So it picked one for me, and then it picked another, another, so yeah.

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:41.380
 It's an interesting setup.

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:47.740
 I'm still using this setup today, actually, a good one.

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:50.120
 Wars of text.

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:56.860
 Now the final theme I want to look into, which is the latest, is called Monte Carlo.

00:06:56.860 --> 00:07:05.500
 First idea here is to bring the idea of picking a random theme to the next level.

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:13.060
 So this is just one theme that generates a random color palette for me, every time.

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:18.180
 Not in NOPA, because I'm not completely satisfied.

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:25.580
 But anyway, how would I pick a random color palette?

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:29.460
 The answer is, again, to look at a different color space.

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:35.340
 In this time is called HLC, which is hue, lightness, and chroma.

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:43.220
 So hue is just colors, red, green, blue, or yellow, whatever, lightness is lightness, chroma

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:46.060
 is saturation, essentially.

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:53.900
 This is great because I could fix both lightness and saturation, and only vary in hue to pick

00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:57.700
 my colors.

00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:07.260
 Now the problem is, once I have the color palette in HLC, how would I convert it to SRGB?

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:12.140
 Because MX only knows about colors in SRGB.

00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:18.100
 The answer here is to go through another color space called XYZ.

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:25.860
 This is an extremely important color space, because basically all other color spaces are

00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:29.540
 defined on top of XYZ.

00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:35.780
 So you would have transformations from XYZ to all other color spaces.

00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:44.900
 Now if you invert these transformations, you could go from, for example, HLC back into XYZ,

00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:49.900
 and then go to another color space of you tracing.

00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:53.140
 So this is how to convert colors between color spaces.

00:08:53.140 --> 00:09:00.980
 In this case, I have to convert colors from HLC to lab, and from lab to XYZ, and from

00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:03.900
 XYZ to SRGB.

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:08.020
 So this time, the conversions are all done in MX list.

00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:16.180
 And I have the code in here in this URL, you could take a look, or you could actually just use

00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:20.380
 maybe some package to convert colors.

00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:25.060
 Anyway, let me show you how this works.

00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:30.780
 So in this case, I could apply theme Monte Carlo.

00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:34.300
 So this is now a random theme actually.

00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:41.220
 Well, a theme with random colors, because I could apply the same theme, and you would

00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:48.620
 look different every time.

00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:57.700
 I could also look at the colors it picked, you know, as a list of colors.

00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:04.140
 I could also look at this like fancy chart of colors.

00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:06.060
 This is too small.

00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:08.220
 So let me show you this.

00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:15.300
 So basically the same thing, this is actually a cross section in the HLC space.

00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:21.980
 And the colors it picked are these white circles.

00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:24.860
 So that's that.

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:30.940
 But I, like I said, I'm not fully satisfied because most of the time, the colors are pretty

00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:33.780
 boring from it.

00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:38.100
 I could think of some ways to improve this.

00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:45.180
 For example, I could choose different patterns of the color samples.

00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:49.180
 But I don't know of any good patterns.

00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:51.300
 So I need to try things out.

00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:57.900
 And then another way is probably to use different color spaces like the HSL or HSV.

00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:02.420
 Again, I need to try this out.

00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:05.220
 So yeah, there are room for improvements.

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:09.820
 If you, if you haven't any idea, you know, let me know.

00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:12.080
 We can try it out.

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:13.980
 So that's the end of my talk.

00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:17.860
 Hopefully you have some new ideas.

00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:23.180
 Thanks for listening in and yeah, go create more themes because we can't have enough.

00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:23.500
 Thanks.

00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:31.180
